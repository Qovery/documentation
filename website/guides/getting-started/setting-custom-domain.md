On Qovery, every application exposed publicly automatically gets a temporary `qovery.io` domain. You can also bring your domains to Qovery
quickly. We handle TLS/SSL certificate creation and renewal, as well as automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirects for all your custom domains. Let’s
learn how to set up your domains on Qovery!

<Assumptions>

* You have a domain
* You have the permission to add a [CNAME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record) record to your domain

</Assumptions>
