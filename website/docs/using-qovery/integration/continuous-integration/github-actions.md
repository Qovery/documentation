Using GitHub Actions with Qovery is super powerful and gives you the ability to manage the way that you want to deploy your applications. As the possibility are endless, I will share with you a couple of examples that you can use. Feel free to adapt them to your need.

## Prerequisites

Before using the examples below, you need to:

1. Install the [Qovery CLI][docs.using-qovery.interface.cli].
2. Generate an [API token][docs.using-qovery.interface.cli#generate-api-token].
3. Set the environment variable `QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN` (`export QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-api-token`) with your API token.
4. You have turned off the [Qovery Auto Deployment][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment#auto-deploy-environment] for your environment that you want to deploy manually.

## GitHub Actions Examples

### Deploy a container application

<Assumptions>

* You have [connected your Container Registry with Qovery][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization#container-registry-management].
* You have a container application that you want to deploy on Qovery.
* You have set the `QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable in your GitHub Actions project.

</Assumptions>

This example will deploy a container application with Qovery from your GitHub CI pipeline. Feel free to adapt it to your need.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/deploy-with-qovery.yml"
# 1. Build and Push image to a remote registry
# 2. Deploy with Qovery

name: Publish Docker image and Deploy with Qovery

  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  deploy_with_qovery:
    name: Push Docker image to Docker Hub and Deploy with Qovery
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repo

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub

        shell: bash
        run: |
          # Download and install Qovery CLI
          curl -s https://get.qovery.com | bash

          qovery container deploy \
            --organization <your_org_name> \
            --project <your_project_name> \
            --environment <your_environment_name> \
            --container <your_qovery_container_name> \
            --tag ${{ github.sha }} \
            --watch
```

## Qovery CLI command examples

### Deploy your application with a specific commit ID

```bash
qovery application deploy \
  --organization <your_org_name> \
  --project <your_project_name> \
  --environment <your_environment_name> \
  --application <your_app_name> \
  --commit-id <your_commit_id> \
  --watch
```

<Alert type="success">

`--watch` is an optional parameter that will display the status of the deployment and return 0 if the deployment is successful or 1 if it fails.

</Alert>

### Deploy your multiple applications with a specific commit ID (monorepo)

```bash
# deploy the application 1 and wait for the deployment to be successful with the --watch argument
qovery application deploy \
  --organization <your_org_name> \
  --project <your_project_name> \
  --environment <your_environment_name> \
  --application <your_app_1_name> \
  --commit-id <your_commit_id> \
  --watch

# deploy the application 2 and wait for the deployment to be successful with the --watch argument
qovery application deploy \
  --organization <your_org_name> \
  --project <your_project_name> \
  --environment <your_environment_name> \
  --application <your_app_2_name> \
  --commit-id <your_commit_id> \
  --watch
```

### Deploy your container with a specific Tag

```shell
qovery application deploy \
  --organization <your_org_name> \
  --project <your_project_name> \
  --environment <your_environment_name> \
  --container <your_container_name> \
  --tag <your_container_tag> \
  --watch
```

### Create a Preview Environment for your Pull-Request

Qovery integrates automatically with GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket to create a Preview Environment for each Pull-Request. But in case you want to control the creation of the Preview Environment manually, you can use the following commands:

```shell
# Clone your base environment
qovery environment clone \
  --organization <your_org_name> \
  --project <your_project_name> \
  --environment <your_environment_name> \
  --new-environment-name <your_new_environment_name>

# Change your application branch to the Pull-Request branch
qovery application update \
  --organization <your_org_name> \
  --project <your_project_name> \
  --environment <your_new_environment_name> \
  --application <your_app_name> \
  --branch <your_pull_request_branch_name>

# Deploy your new environment
qovery environment deploy \
  --organization <your_org_name> \
  --project <your_project_name> \
  --environment <your_new_environment_name> \
  --watch
```

### Delete a Preview Environment

```shell
qovery environment delete \
  --organization <your_org_name> \
  --project <your_project_name> \
  --environment <your_preview_environment_name> \
  --watch
```

### Terraform
