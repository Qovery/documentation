<Alert type="info">

Please refer to [this page][docs.using-qovery.configuration.provider.kubernetes] if you want to install Qovery on your own Kubernetes cluster (BYOK).

</Alert>

Qovery lets you quickly deploy applications to your [GCP (GCP)][urls.gcp] account. No knowledge needed, and it takes less than 10 minutes to install Qovery on your GCP account.

## Getting started

<Assumptions>

* You have a [Qovery][docs.using-qovery.interface] account
* You have created an [Organization][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization]
* You have a GCP account

</Assumptions>

### Connect your GCP account

To link your GCP account to Qovery you need to provide a GCP JSON credentials key.

<Alert type="info">

You can link more than one GCP account. Qovery also support multiple Cloud providers within the same Organization. Meaning, you can balance your workload on different Cloud providers. [Read more][guides.advanced].

</Alert>

#### Create your GCP credentials

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

<li>

[Connect to your GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com)

</li>

<li>

Create a new `Project` and get the project id
<img src="/img/gcp-credentials/gcp_project.png" />

</li>

<li>

Open the embedded Google shell
<img src="/img/gcp-credentials/gcp_shell_1.png" />

</li>

<li>

Download the following [script](../../../../../static/files/create_credentials_gcp.sh)

</li>

<li>

Upload the script to the Google shell
<img src="/img/gcp-credentials/gcp_shell_2.png" />
<img src="/img/gcp-credentials/gcp_shell_3.png" />

</li>

<li>

Make the script executable

```bash
chmod +x create_credentials_gcp.sh
```

</li>

<li>

Run the script with the following command:

```bash
./create_credentials_gcp.sh <project_id> <service_account_name>
```

<img src="/img/gcp-credentials/gcp_shell_4.png" />

</li>

<li>

Once the script is done. A GCP JSON credentials key has been created and you can download it.
<img src="/img/gcp-credentials/gcp_shell_5.png" />
<img src="/img/gcp-credentials/gcp_shell_6.png" />

</li>
</ol>
</Steps>

Well done!! You now have your GCP `JSON credentials key`; It is time to connect Qovery to your GCP account.

### Install a new cluster on Qovery

You will be able to use the credentials you just generated when creating a cluster via the Qovery console. This cluster will be linked to your Qovery organization.
Follow [this documentation][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#creating-a-cluster] to create a new cluster on your organization.

### Remove your GCP account

<Alert type="warning">

Your applications and your data will be deleted.

</Alert>

To delete Qovery from your GCP account you must be the owner of the Organization.
Once your GCP account removed from Qovery, everything configured (VPC, Kubernetes, databases, ...) by Qovery will be deleted forever.
