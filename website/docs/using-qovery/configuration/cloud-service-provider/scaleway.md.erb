Qovery lets you quickly deploy applications to your [Scaleway (Scaleway)][urls.scaleway] account. No knowledge needed, and it takes less than 10 minutes to install Qovery on your Scaleway account.

<Alert type="info">

Do you want to know more about how Qovery works on your Scaleway account? [Here][docs.useful-resources.faq#how-qovery-works-under-the-hood] is explained how Qovery works under the hood.

## Getting started

<Assumptions>

* You have a [Qovery][docs.using-qovery.interface] account
* You have created an [Organization][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization]
* You have a Scaleway account

</Assumptions>

### Connect your Scaleway account

To link your Scaleway account to Qovery you need to provide a Scaleway `access key id`, `secret access key` and a `project id`.

<Alert type="warning">

If your Scaleway account is new, you need to open a ticket to Scaleway support to unlock your quota. You can post the following message:
"Hello, I am going to deploy my applications on Scaleway with Qovery. Can you increase my quota for current Kubernetes nodes type, to 10 please? Thanks

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

You can link more than one Scaleway account. Qovery also support multiple Cloud providers within the same Organization. Meaning, you can balance your workload on different Cloud providers. [Read more][guides.advanced].

</Alert>

#### Create your Scaleway credentials - `access key id`, `secret access key` and `project id`.

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

<li>

[Connect to your Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)

</li>

<li>

Go to `Credentials`
<img src="/img/scw-create-credentials-1.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

Copy your `project ID` and generate new API key
<img src="/img/scw-create-credentials-2.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

Generate your new API key
<img src="/img/scw-create-credentials-3.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

Copy the generated `access key id` and `secret access key`.

<img src="/img/scw-create-credentials-4.jpg" />

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

Well done!! You now have your Scaleway `access key id`, `secret access key` and `project id`; It's time to connect Qovery to your Scaleway account.

## Stop a cluster 

Once your cluster is running, you might want to pause it for a while in order to save money when you don't need it (weekends, night...).
