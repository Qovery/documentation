## How does it works?

You can find this feature inside the organization settings â†’ Clusters.

You should land on this page and if your setup is running you should see a green dot on the left side of your cloud provider logo.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/stop-cluster1.png" alt="stop-cluster1" />
</p>

To stop it, you can click on the three dots on the right and you should see a panel with "stop" as per below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/stop-cluster2.png" alt="stop-cluster2" />
</p>

Shortly after stopping it, you should see a new screen that indicates you that your cluster is pausing.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/stop-cluster3.png" alt="stop-cluster3" />
</p>

Once the cluster stopped, the dot on the left side of your cloud provider should turn grey and you should have the mention "paused" under the name of your cluster.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/stop-cluster4.png" alt="stop-cluster4" />
</p>

If you want to restart it, you just need to go on the three dots on the right again and click on "Resume".

</p>
