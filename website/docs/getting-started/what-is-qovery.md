## Qovery For DevOps

Qovery is helpful for DevOps teams as it allows them to automate the provisioning, configuration, and management of infrastructure resources. This can help to streamline the process of creating and destroying environments on demand and reduce the time and effort required to set up and manage environments. Additionally, Qovery provides features such as resource consumption optimization, which can help to reduce cloud costs and optimize infrastructure costs. This can help to free up resources and focus on delivering value to the business. Qovery also helps DevOps teams to maintain a high level of control, security and governance by providing a way to define, manage and monitor their infrastructure as code, thus reducing human error and ensuring compliance with best practices and security standards.

## Qovery For Developers

For developers, Qovery is helpful as it allows them to easily spin up services with minimal effort. This allows developers to focus on writing code and delivering features, rather than worrying about infrastructure management. Additionally, Qovery provides a way to manage multiple environments and configurations, which can help to ensure that the development, staging, and production environments are consistent and up-to-date. This can help to reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies and ensure that the application is always ready for deployment. Developers can also be assured that their environments are secure and compliant with best practices and security standards, thanks to the control and governance features provided by Qovery.
