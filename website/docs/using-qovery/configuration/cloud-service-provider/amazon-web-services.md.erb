Qovery lets you quickly deploy applications to your [Amazon Web Services (AWS)][urls.aws] account. No knowledge needed, and it takes less than 20 minutes to install Qovery on your AWS account.

<Alert type="info">

Do you want to know more about how Qovery works on your AWS account? [Here][docs.useful-resources.faq#how-qovery-works-under-the-hood] is explained how Qovery works under the hood.

## Getting started

<Assumptions>

* You have a [Qovery][docs.using-qovery.interface] account
* You have created an [Organization][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization]
* You have an AWS account

</Assumptions>

### Connect your AWS account

To link your AWS account to Qovery you need to provide an AWS `access key id` and `secret access key` with the [required IAM permissions][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.amazon-web-services].

<Alert type="info">

You can link more than one AWS account. Qovery also support multiple Cloud providers within the same Organization. Meaning, you can balance your workload on different Cloud providers. [Read more][guides.advanced].

#### Create your AWS credentials - `access key id` and `secret access key`

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

<li>

[Connect to your AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com)

</li>

<li>

Go to `My Security Credentials`
<img src="/img/aws-my-security-credentials.png" />

</li>

<li>

Create `Admins` group **without any permissions**

<Alert type="warning">

The name of the group MUST be Admins. If you use another name, this will not work

</Alert>


<img src="/img/aws-create-group-1.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-group-2.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-group-3.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-group-4.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

Create one IAM user called `qovery`.
<img src="/img/aws-create-user-1.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-user-2.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-user-3.jpg" />

Go to the last step and copy your `access key id` and `secret access key`.

<img src="/img/aws-create-user-4.jpg" />

</li>

<li>


Setup<a href="/files/qovery-iam-aws.json"> IAM permissions</a> to the `qovery` user.

</Alert>

**Then, follow the arrows in AWS console to create AWS credentials with required IAM permissions:**

<img src="/img/aws-add-policy-1.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-add-policy-2.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-add-policy-3.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-add-policy-4.jpg" />

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

Well done!! You now have your AWS `access key id` and `secret access key` and your permissions are setups; It is time to connect Qovery to your AWS account.

#### Use AWS credentials with Qovery

<%= qovery_web_interface_coming_soon %>

### Remove your AWS account

<%= qovery_web_interface_coming_soon %>

### Delete Qovery from your AWS account

<Alert type="warning">

Your applications and your data will be deleted.

</Alert>

To delete Qovery from your AWS account you must be the owner of the Organization.
Once your AWS account removed from Qovery, everything configured (VPC, Kubernetes, ...) by Qovery will be deleted forever.

### IAM permissions

Qovery required IAM permissions to create, update and managed the infrastructure.

- IAM is used to create IAM roles
- S3 is used to store our generated configuration files
- Cloudwatch, for creating a group stream for each Kubernetes clusters
- Autoscaling for RDS and autoscaling rules for the Kubernetes cluster
- Elastic load-balancing for ELB / ALB / NLB.
- DynamoDB to have a distributed lock on infrastructure deployment.
- ECR for managing the container registry, create/update/delete repository.
- KMS to load and store keys (RDS, SSH, …)
- EKS to create and update the Kubernetes cluster.

## Manually configure VPC subnet

VPC subnet is automatically defined by Qovery on cluster creation. However, you may want to choose your own VPC subnet, for example to perform VPC Peering. 

<Alert type="info">

If you want to perform VPC Peering with Qovery, please refer to our guide [VPC Peering with Qovery](https://hub.qovery.com/guides/tutorial/aws-vpc-peering-with-qovery/) to be assisted step by step. 

</Alert>

During the adding of a new cluster in your organization, you will have the opportunity to choose and set up the features of your cluster. In this list of features, you can activate the `VPC subnet` feature and choose in the drop-down menu the subnet you want to use. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/cluster-vpc-subnet.png" alt="VPC subnet cluster" />
</p>

<Alert type="warning">

You will not be able to activate/deactivate these features once the cluster has been deployed for the first time.

</Alert>

## Configure routing table

You may want to create and edit a network routing table to perform VPC peering. This can be done by accessing to the parameters of a cluster, in the settings of your organization. 

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>
<li>

Go in the settings of your organization.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/organization-setting.png" alt="Organization setting" />
</p>

</li>
<li>

Go in the `Cluster` tab and in the `...` menu of a cluster to access to its `Settings`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/cluster-setting.png" alt="Cluster setting" />
</p>

</li>
<li>

In the Cluster setting modal, go in `Network` tab.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/network-cluster.png" alt="Cluster network settings" />
</p>

</li>
<li>

Add a line to the routing table by clicking on the `Add route` button. In this modal, you can specify the Target, the Destination and add a description to justify the new route.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/routing-table.png" alt="Routing table" />
</p>

</li>
</ol>
</Steps>
