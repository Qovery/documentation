Qovery offers two distinct approaches to Kubernetes management: Kubernetes managed by Qovery and self-managed Kubernetes (Bring Your Own Kubernetes - BYOK)

<Alert type="info">

In a nutshell, choose Kubernetes Managed by Qovery if you are not familiar with Kubernetes or you don't want to bother with it and delegate infrastructure management to Qovery. Choose BYOK otherwise.

</Alert>

Here is a table to help you to choose between both:

| Feature/Aspect                        | Kubernetes Managed by Qovery                   | BYOK (Bring Your Own Kubernetes)                 |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Management**                        | Fully managed by Qovery                        | Self-managed by the organization                 |
| **Control**                           | Limited control over Kubernetes infrastructure | Full control over Kubernetes setup               |
| **Supported Cloud Service Providers** | AWS, GCP, Scaleway                             | All                                              |
| **Customization**                     | Standard Qovery configuration                  | High customization and configuration freedom     |
| **Expertise Required**                | None                                           | Requires Kubernetes expertise                    |
| **Responsibility**                    | Qovery is responsible for maintenance          | Organization is responsible for maintenance      |
| **Developer Experience**              | Streamlined and simplified                     | Streamlined and simplified (no difference)       |
| **Setup Complexity**                  | Just a AWS, GCP or Scaleway account            | Requires infrastructure and Kubernetes knowledge |
| **Flexibility in Usage**              | Standardized to Qovery's environment           | Flexible to meet specific organizational needs   |
| **Ideal Use Case**                    | Organizations preferring a hands-off approach  | Organizations with specific Kubernetes needs     |
| **Managed Services**                  | Cf. list below                                 | N/A                                              |
