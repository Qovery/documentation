## Generate your GCP credentials

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

<li>

[Connect to your GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com)

</li>

<li>

Create a new `Project` or open an exiting one

<p align="center">

</p>

</li>

<li>

Open the embedded Google shell

  <img src="/img/gcp-credentials/gcp_shell_1.png" />
</p>

</li>

<li>

Run the following command in the Google Shell to create the service account and generate the json key:

```bash
curl https://hub.qovery.com/files/create_credentials_gcp.sh | \
bash -s -- $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT qovery-service-account
```

<Alert type="info">

You can modify the service account name by replacing `qovery-service-account` by the name of your choice.

</Alert>

</li>

<li>

Once the script is finished, you will see the following message:

```
created key [xxxx] of type [json] as [key.json] for [qovery-service-account@<your-project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com]
Operations completed. You can now download your json key to upload in Qovery
```

So you can download it by clicking on the `Download` button.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/gcp-credentials/gcp_shell_5.png" />
</p>

And specify the name of the file `/your/home/key.json` and click on `Download`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/gcp-credentials/gcp_shell_6.png" />
</p>

That's it!

</li>
</ol>
</Steps>

Well done!! You now have your GCP `JSON credentials key`; It is time to connect Qovery to your GCP account.

### Install a new cluster on Qovery

You will be able to use the credentials you just generated when creating a cluster via the Qovery console. This cluster will be linked to your Qovery organization.
Follow [this documentation][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#creating-a-cluster] to create a new cluster on your organization.
