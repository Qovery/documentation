The Logs interface allows you to access:
- **The deployment logs**: every time a deployment is triggered, Qovery provides you with the log of its execution and as well with any error that might occur.
- **The service logs** of your applications: Qovery allows you to retrieve the logs of your application in real-time, streamed directly from your remote application (no data is stored on Qovery side).  The logs are accessible as long as the application is running and writing the logs in the `stdout`.

## How to access the logs

The `Logs` interface can be accessed from the console through multiple entry points:

**Service Logs:**
* Click the **scroll icon** next to your service to view application runtime logs

**Pipeline Logs:**
* Click the **pipeline icon** to access the deployment pipeline view for your environment

**Deployment Logs:**
* Click the **deployment status label** beneath your service name to view deployment-specific logs (Available for "deployment ongoing" and "deployment failed" statuses)

Each log view is contextually filtered to show only relevant information for the selected scope, helping you quickly identify and troubleshoot issues at the appropriate level.

### Pipeline view

The pipeline view provides a comprehensive overview of your entire environment deployment process. This centralized view displays each deployment stage, including pre-check validations, giving you complete visibility into the deployment workflow.

**Key Features:**
* **Stage-by-stage visibility**: Monitor each phase of your deployment
* **Pre-check logs**: Access validation logs that run before the actual deployment begins
* **Direct service access**: Click on any service within the pipeline to jump directly to its specific deployment logs
* **Smart filtering**: Services not included in the current deployment are automatically hidden to reduce clutter and focus on active components

**Note:** If you've deployed only selected services from your environment, uninvolved services won't appear in the pipeline view since they're skipped during that particular deployment cycle.

### Deployment Logs

By default, you get access to the logs of the last deployment execution but you can switch to the previous execution (See [Accessing old deployment logs](#accessing-old-deployment-logs)).

If the service is built via the Qovery CI pipeline, you will get access to the build logs.

When the deployment on Kubernetes is executed, the system will provide you with the deployment status updates. In case of deployment issues, these updates will provide you with some information on the root cause.

At the end of the deployment, a final message is emitted confirming if the deployment was successful or not and, in case of an issue, it provides you with some information on how to solve the issue.

</p>

You can use the [Troubleshoot section][docs.using-qovery.troubleshoot] to investigate any issue you might encounter during the deployment of your services.

#### Accessing old deployment logs

You can access the logs of a past deployment execution in two ways:
- using the `Deployment log switch` on the logs view
- from the `Deployment history` tab from the service or environment page and clicking on the `pipeline` icon of a previous deployment

</p>

<Alert type="info">

Qovery provides access to the logs of the last 20 deployments executed on your environment and the latest failed deployment. If your service has been deployed more than 20 deployments ago, you won't be able to access its deployment logs.

</Alert>

### Service Logs

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/deployment/live_logs.png" alt="Log content" />
</p>

The service logs give you a real-time view of the logs generated by your application while running remotely on your cloud provider infrastructure.

Within this section you will find:
- **Timestamp:** The timestamp of the message
- **Pod Name:** The name of the kubernetes pod where your application is running (to distinguish instances in case of multi-instance apps). You can filter logs by clicking on the pod name to follow a specific pod
- **Version:** The commit ID or image tag of the application running on this pod
- **Message:** The log message
- **Container:** The name of the specific container running within your service (particularly useful when working with Helm charts that may deploy multiple containers per service)

If you have several pods within your application, you can filter the logs by pod.

#### Log Retention & Access

Past application logs are preserved on your cluster via [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) and can be accessed from the same log view within the Qovery console:

**With Observability Package:** (See the [Observability Section][docs.using-qovery.observability.logs] to know more)
- Full historical log access with 12 weeks retention
- No line limit - access to complete log history
- Enhanced filtering and correlation with metrics

**Without Observability Package:**
- Access to the latest 1000 lines of logs per service
- 12 weeks retention for these logs
- Real-time logs only (no historical search capabilities)

> **Note:** Log retention period can be configured via the [cluster advanced settings][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cluster-advanced-settings#logs]

If you need to troubleshoot issues on requests managed by your application, you can also access the Nginx logs in the same view (logs format is available in the helper). This option is available only if the application is exposed publicly (See the [Port Section][docs.using-qovery.configuration.application#ports]).
