[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com?ref=qovery) (AWS) is a platform that offers flexible, reliable, and scalable Cloud computing solutions. The platform is developed with a combination of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings. In 2021, thousands of companies host their apps on AWS. In 2006, AWS was composed of only 3 services (SQS, S3, EC2) that were simple to use. In 2021, more than 200 services and 2000 features exist, and deploying your app can take days.

> [Qovery][urls.qovery] is the simplest way to deploy your apps on AWS.

In this tutorial, I will explain step by step how to deploy your app on AWS in 30 minutes. No AWS/infrastructure/Cloud knowledge required - no kidding!

# Step-by-step: Install Qovery on AWS
## Create an AWS account

*If you already have an AWS account, you can go to the next point.*

Before creating an AWS account, I'd recommend contacting AWS to see if you are eligible to free credits. AWS provides up to $100k of credits for 12 to 24 months. Which is convenient to have at the beginning of a project. If you know that you are not eligible, you can create your account by clicking on the top right button `Create an AWS Account` of their [main page](https://aws.amazon.com?ref=qovery).

### Get your AWS API keys

<Alert type="info">

Follow [this guide][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.amazon-web-services#connect-your-aws-account] to create your AWS credentials

</Alert>

To install Qovery on your AWS account, the `secret access key` and `access key id` are required. Here is a comprehensive [step-by-step guide][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.amazon-web-services#connect-your-aws-account] on how to generate your `secret access key` and `access key id`. If you already have those keys, then you can go to the next point.

## Configure Qovery

### Sign-up to Qovery
Using Qovery is as simple as connect with your *Github* or *Gitlab* account on [start.qovery.com][urls.start_qovery].

-> [Connect to Qovery][urls.start_qovery]

### Create your Organization

<Alert type="info">

You can skip this step if you already have an Organization.

</Alert>

An organization is a shared account where developers can collaborate across many projects at once. Owners and organization administrators can manage:
- Cloud accounts.
- Members access.
- Billing.

[Read more][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization] about Organizations

To deploy on your AWS account, you have to choose between **Free**, **Professional** and **Business** plan for your organization.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/create_organization.jpg" alt="Qovery - Create an Organization and select the plan" />
</p>

### Install Qovery on your AWS account

1/ Go to your organization settings by clicking on the "cog" icon next to your organization name.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/organization_settings_clusters_empty.jpg" alt="Go your organization settings > clusters" />
</p>

2/ Create a cluster, select *Amazon Web Services* and the region where you want to deploy your apps.

<Alert type="success">

Choose a region close to where your users will use your applications to have better performances.

</Alert>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/organization_settings_create_cluster.jpg" alt="Create a cluster" />
</p>

3/ Set your AWS credentials. (Check out [this guide][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.amazon-web-services] if you have no AWS credentials).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/organization_settings_add_credentials.jpg" alt="Set your cloud credentials" />
</p>

4/ Under the hood, Qovery uses a managed Kubernetes ([AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks)) to run your applications. You need to specify the CPU and RAM you want per node, and the min/max number of nodes. Qovery will keep low the number of nodes and will only scale up your nodes if your applications really need to scale.

<Alert type="success">

Qovery optimizes and keep your AWS costs low.

</Alert>

5/ Click on **Save** and **Deploy**.

</p>
