## What is the difference between a Project, Application, and Environment?

A [project][docs.using-qovery.configuration.project] is the site that you're working on. Each project can contain multiple [applications][docs.using-qovery.configuration.application] and be deployed in multiple [environments][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment]. An environment is a standalone copy of your site, including apps, databases, storage, data, and all other services. By default, `main` branch is the production environment, while all other branches can be set up as identical copies of the prod environment for testing purposes.

## How does application build works?

Basically, Qovery deploys your application as a container. Check out the detailed explanation of what is going on behind the scene [here][docs.devops.qovery-for-devops-introduction#application-and-database-deployment]

## How does Qovery manage databases?

Qovery provides `managed` and `container` modes for your databases. Basically, `managed` mode relies on the managed database provided by the cloud provider. E.g. if you choose `Postgres` with the `managed` mode while your environment is running on AWS, then Qovery provides an [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds) instance. Please check out our [database section][docs.using-qovery.configuration.database] for further details.

## Does Qovery replace Kubernetes?

Behind the scene, Qovery uses [Kubernetes][urls.kubernetes]. Qovery extends Kubernetes to make it accessible to any developer teams.
Important: Qovery does not modify Kubernetes. It only deploys his services in a `qovery` Kubernetes namespace.

## Does Qovery support mono repository?

Yes, absolutely! Check out [our monorepo guide][guides.advanced.monorepository].

## Does Qovery support microservices?

Yes, absolutely! Check out [our microservices guide][guides.advanced.microservices].

## What Git providers do you support?

GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket.

## Do you support GitHub Enterprise or Gitlab Self-hosted?

Not at the moment, but you can upvote for this feature in [our roadmap][urls.qovery_roadmap].

## Does Qovery support private Git repository ?

Yes, absolutely!

## What is the IP address of my Kubernetes cluster?

Static IP is only supported for Kubernetes clusters running on AWS. You can enable the option in the feature settings of your cluster.

## If I have N custom domains under the same root domain, do I need to create N CNAME records, or just creating one for the root domain is enough ?

You have to create N CNAME, one per custom domain

## How do you support new Kubernetes version?

The Qovery team manages your Kubernetes cluster's upgrade, and you don't have to think about it. Upgrades from one minor Kubernetes version to another require a good amount of tests to make sure everything goes smoothly with zero interruptions for your app. This is why Qovery always provides 1 or 2 minor versions below the last one offered by the cloud provider. Our goal is to guarantee you the maximum uptime.

## What do you do when a vulnerability is found?

Security is our main concern. When a vulnerability is found, here are the actions that we take:

1. We quickly identify how significant is the impact of the vulnerability.
2. We look at how we can solve or mitigate the vulnerability.
3. We transparently communicate with our customers on the vulnerability to help them take the right actions.

## Can I have access to my Kubernetes cluster?

Absolutely, you can follow [this guide][guides.tutorial.how-to-connect-to-your-eks-cluster-with-kubectl].

## Can I have access to my application with a shell?

Absolutely, check out our [CLI][docs.using-qovery.interface.cli#shell] and the `qovery shell` command.

## How application auto-scaling works?

Take a look at [our application documentation][docs.using-qovery.configuration.application#auto-scaling].

## Why you should use Qovery?

You don't need to hire infrastructure experts - configuring continuous integration, deployment, databases, message brokers, storage, DNS, SSL/TLS, VPCs, and many others - we do it all for you. On Qovery, you can spin up a set of microservices, databases, and other cloud services in minutes with a single Git push!
