Within this section you will find the common errors you might encounter when deploying or running your Lifecycle Job with Qovery

## Joib failed: either it couldn't be executed correctly after X retries or its execution didn't finish after Y minutes

This errors occurs in the following two cases:

**Job code execution failures**
The pod running your lifecycle job is crashing due to an exception in your code or OOM issue. Have a look at the Live Logs of your Lifecycle job to understand from where the issue is coming from your code.

**Job execution timeout**
The code run in your job is taking more time than expected and thus it's execution is stopped. If your code needs more time to be excecuted, increase the `Max Duration` value within the [Lifecycle Job configuration page][docs.using-qovery.configuration.lifecycle-job#job-configuration]
