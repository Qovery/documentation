## Creating an Organization

### When Signing Up

When signing up for Qovery, you need to sign in through your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket). 

Once this is done, you can create your first organization and the first project within it. Before completing the creation process, you need to choose one of our 3 plans:

- Free
- Team
- Enterprise

To create a new organization:

2. Click on the `+` button in the top right corner of the dropdown.
