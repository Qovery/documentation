[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com?ref=qovery) (AWS) is a platform that offers flexible, reliable, and scalable Cloud computing solutions. The platform is developed with a combination of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings. In 2021, thousands of companies host their apps on AWS. In 2006, AWS was composed of only 3 services (SQS, S3, EC2) that were simple to use. In 2021, more than 200 services and 2000 features exist, and deploying your app can take days.

> [Qovery][urls.qovery] is the simplest way to deploy your apps on AWS.

In this tutorial, I will explain step by step how to deploy your app on AWS in 30 minutes. No AWS/infrastructure/Cloud knowledge required - no kidding!

# Step-by-step: Install Qovery on AWS
## Create an AWS account

*If you already have an AWS account, you can go to the next point.*

Before creating an AWS account, I'd recommend contacting AWS to see if you are eligible to free credits. AWS provides up to $100k of credits for 12 to 24 months. Which is convenient to have at the beginning of a project. If you know that you are not eligible, you can create your account by clicking on the top right button `Create an AWS Account` of their [main page](https://aws.amazon.com?ref=qovery).

### Get your AWS API keys

<Alert type="info">

Follow [this guide][docs.getting-started.install-qovery.aws.cluster-managed-by-qovery.quickstart#attach-aws-credentials] to create your AWS credentials

</Alert>

To install Qovery on your AWS account, the `secret access key` and `access key id` are required. Here is a comprehensive [step-by-step guide][docs.getting-started.install-qovery.aws.cluster-managed-by-qovery.quickstart#attach-aws-credentials] on how to generate your `secret access key` and `access key id`. If you already have those keys, then you can go to the next point.

## Configure Qovery

### Sign-up to Qovery
Using Qovery is as simple as connect with your *Github*, *Gitlab* or *Bitbucket* account on [start.qovery.com][urls.start_qovery].

-> [Connect to Qovery][urls.start_qovery]

### Create your Organization

<Alert type="info">

You can skip this step if you already have an Organization.

</Alert>

An organization is a shared account where developers can collaborate across many projects at once. Owners and organization administrators can manage:
- Cloud accounts.
- Members access.
- Billing.

[Read more][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization] about Organizations

To deploy on your AWS account, you have to choose between **Free**, **Professional** and **Business** plan for your organization.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/organization/Qovery_Pricing_Plans.png" alt="Qovery - Create an Organization and select the plan" />
</p>

### Install Qovery on your AWS account

1/ Go to your organization settings by clicking on the "cog" icon next to your organization name.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/organization_settings_clusters_empty.jpg" alt="Go your organization settings > clusters" />
</p>

2/ Create a cluster, select *Amazon Web Services* and the region where you want to deploy your apps.

<Alert type="success">

Choose a region close to where your users will use your applications to have better performances.

</Alert>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/organization_settings_create_cluster.jpg" alt="Create a cluster" />
</p>

3/ Set your AWS credentials. (Check out [this guide][docs.getting-started.install-qovery.aws.cluster-managed-by-qovery.quickstart] if you have no AWS credentials).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/organization_settings_add_credentials.jpg" alt="Set your cloud credentials" />
</p>

4/ Under the hood, Qovery uses a managed Kubernetes ([AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks)) to run your applications. You need to specify the instance type that you would like to use and the min/max number of nodes. Qovery will keep low the number of nodes and will only scale up your nodes if your applications really need to scale.
If you don't know which instance type to chose, have a look at the AWS instance list or use the helper to chose the right instance based on your CPU/RAM needs.

<Alert type="success">

Qovery optimizes and keep your AWS costs low.

</Alert>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/organization_settings_cluster_resources.jpg" alt="Set your cluster resources" />
</p>

<Alert type="info">
Qovery might use some temporary free resources on your Kubernetes cluster to perform spotted maintenance operations (e.g. : cluster version upgrades).
This is why we recommend a cluster setup with:
<ul>
  <li>at least 20% difference between the minimum and the maximum number of nodes;</li>
  <li>at least 5 nodes as the maximum number of nodes of your cluster;</li>
</ul>
</Alert>

5/ Click on **Save** and **Deploy**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/organization_settings_clusters_aws.jpg" alt="AWS cluster is now available" />
</p>

Congrats! Qovery will be installed within 30 minutes ðŸŽ‰. You will be notified when it is all good.
In the meantime, you can take a look at our [guide section][guides.getting-started].

6/ Enable cluster sync with SSO account

If you're using SSO for your AWS account deploying the Qovery cluster you have to add some infos in the *aws-auth configmap* in `kube-system` namespace.
Connect to your cluster and edit the *aws-auth configmap* in order to add the following code in the mapRoles section:

```yaml
- rolearn: arn:aws:iam::<iam_id>:role/AWSReservedSSO_AdministratorAccess_<the_role_id>
  username: "{{SessionName}}"
  groups:
  - system:masters
```

## Deploy your application
Once Qovery is installed on your AWS account, you have the possibility to deploy your application. Take a look to [our guide][guides.getting-started] on how to [deploy your first application][guides.getting-started.deploy-your-first-application] with Qovery.
