- **Resources**: 4 CPU and 8GB of RAM for your Docker runtime.
- **Binaries**: [docker][urls.docker], jq, curl, sed, grep, git.

```

A k3s Kubernetes cluster will be installed on your local machine and Qovery will be installed on top of it.

Note that if you are on MacOS or Windows, you might be prompted for your admin password - which is necessary to properly route the traffic from your host to your k3s apps.

```shell
...
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Configure network
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
+ sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 172.42.0.3/32 up
Password:
...
```

At the end of the installation, you will see the following message:

```shell
...

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Qovery demo cluster is now installed !!!!
The kubeconfig is correctly set, so you can connect to it directly with kubectl or k9s from your local machine
To delete/stop/start your cluster, use k3d cluster xxxx

Go to https://console.qovery.com to create your first environment on this cluster 'hello-local-cluster'
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
```

</li>

<li>

Access the Qovery dashboard by visiting [console.qovery.com][urls.qovery_console].

</li>

</ol>
</Steps>

Well done, you have successfully installed Qovery on your local machine. You can now start deploying your applications and experience the Qovery experience.

## Cleanup your local environment

To clean up your local environment, run the following command:

That's it! You have successfully removed the Qovery demo cluster from your local machine.
