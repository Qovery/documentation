JupyterHub is an easy way to interact with a computing environment through a webpage. It provides a standardized way to serve Jupyter Notebooks for multiple users. Pairing it with Kubernetes and Qovery makes it easier to manage and scale.

<Assumptions name="guide">

- You have a Qovery cluster ready
- You have a dedicated Qovery project and environment to deploy JupyterHub (example: Project=JupyterHub, Environment=Production)

</Assumptions>

## Installation

The easiest way to deploy JupyterHub is using the official [Helm Chart](https://github.com/jupyterhub/helm-chart). It will create all the resources you need to run JupyterHub.

For more information, the official documentation is available [here](https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/jupyterhub/installation.html).

<Steps headingDepth={3}>

<ol>

<li>

#### Add the JupyterHub helm repository

Add the JupyterHub helm repository in your Qovery settings by following [this documentation][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.helm-repository]

* Repository name: `JupyterHub`
* Kind: `HTTPS`
* Repository URL: `https://hub.jupyter.org/helm-chart/`

</li>

<li>

#### Create the JupyterHub service within Qovery

Create the JupyterHub service in the Qovery environment of your choice (preferably within a dedicated JupyterHub project) by following [this documentation][docs.using-qovery.configuration.helm] and these values:

* General:
  * Application name: `JupyterHub`
  * Source:
    * Helm source: `Helm repository`
    * Repository: `JupyterHub` (the name given during the JupyterHub helm repository added in the previous step)
    * Chart name: `jupyterhub`
    * Version: `3.3.7` (this is the version we used for this setup, update it based on the chosen version)
    * Allow cluster-wide resources :heavy_check_mark:
* Values
  * Values override as file:
  * File source: `Raw YAML`
  * Raw YAML:

<Tabs
  centered={true}
  className={"rounded"}
  defaultValue={"default"}
  placeholder="Select your cluster type"
  select={false}
  size={null}
  values={[{"group":"Cluster","label":"Default","value":"default"},{"group":"Cluster","label":"EKS with Karpenter","value":"karpenter"}]}>

<TabItem value="default">

```yaml
fullnameOverride: "jupyterhub"
proxy:
    service:
        type: ClusterIP
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="karpenter">

To avoid [a known issue](https://hub.qovery.com/guides/advanced/deploy-daemonset-with-karpenter/) with Karpenter, we need to add a priorityClass to our pods. It is possible to do this using built-in configuration keys:

```yaml
fullnameOverride: "jupyterhub"
proxy:
    service:
        type: ClusterIP
scheduling:
    podPriority:
        enabled: true
        globalDefault: true
        defaultPriority: 50
        imagePullerPriority: 1000
        userPlaceholderPriority: 0
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>




There are many other values you can set to modify the JupyterHub behavior. For advanced usage, check: [JupyterHub Customization](https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/jupyterhub/customization.html)

Now get to the last step and `Create` the service on Qovery.

</li>

<li>

#### Add Network configuration

In the previous step, we created the JupyterHub service. In this step, we will update its configuration to make it available on the public network (through Qovery Nginx Ingress).

* Open the JupyterHub service details
* Enter the `Settings` section
* Click on `Networking`
* Add a new Port with:
  * Service name: jupyterhub-proxy-public
  * Service port: 80
  * Select protocol: HTTP
  * External port: 443
  * Port name: jupyterhub-proxy-public-p80

If you need more information on how to manage your ports, have a look at [this](https://hub.qovery.com/docs/using-qovery/configuration/application/#ports)

</li>

<li>

#### Deploy your chart

Open the `Play` button and trigger the deployment of your chart.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/deploy-jupyterhub-qovery/deploy.png" alt="JupyterHub - Deploy" />
</p>

</li>

<li>

#### Access JupyterHub

You can click the `Link` button to access JupyterHub on your cluster.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/deploy-jupyterhub-qovery/link.png" alt="JupyterHub - Link" />
</p>

Now you can login to the webUI and start playing with Jupyter Notebooks.

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

## Conclusion

JupyterHub is running on your Qovery cluster. This is a simple installation and you should try to [customize](https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/jupyterhub/customization.html) it according to your needs. You can also check the[Adminstrator Guide](https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/administrator/index.html)to better understand how it works.
