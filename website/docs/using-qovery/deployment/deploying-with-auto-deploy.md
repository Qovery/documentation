Once you have configured your services and deployed them for the first time, you can decide to automatically update the applications to the latest version of your git branch thanks to the auto-deploy feauture.

Each time a commit is pushed on your git repository, Qovery receives a webhook call containing the commit information (who did it, what changed, which branch etc..). Thanks to this information, Qovery is able to determine which application should be automatically re-deployed with the new version.

## How to activate it

The auto-deploy feature can be activated from the application settings, by switching on the auto-deploy flag.

</p>

It can also be activated on the first step of the service creation flow

  <img src="/img/deployment/auto-deploy-creation-flow.png" alt="Auto-deploy creation flow" />
</p>

Once this flag is activated, every new commit pushed on the branch of the application will trigger an automatic deployment of the new version.

### Filtering commits triggering the auto-deploy

By default every new commit pushed on the branch will trigger a deployment of the application. You can use the `Deployment restrictions` feature to include or exclude certain files or folders from the feature and avoid un-necessary deployments (like a change on the README file).

To add a new restriction, go into the `Deployment restrictions` section of your application settings.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/deployment/deployment_restrictions.png" alt="Deployment restrictions" />
</p>

When adding a new restriction, two modes can be selected:

- EXCLUDE: commits on the file or folder defined in the "Value" field will be ignored
- MATCH: only commits on the file or folder defined in the "Value" field will trigger a deployment

Note: 
- "Value" should contain the full file path and cant' start with `/`
- Wildcards are not supported in the "Value" field (you can specify "my-prefix*" to exclude commits on files starting with "my-prefix")

## Auto-deploy and container images

The auto-deploy feature can be activated as well if you directly deploy your container images but it requires some additional integration via your CI/CD. Your CI/CD has to inform Qovery that a new version of the image (a new tag) is available for a specific container image. Thanks to this information, Qovery can find any application that uses this container image and automatically trigger a deployment of the new image tag.

To inform Qovery of the new version, your CI/CD needs to call the following endpoints, depending on the service type:
- Container: https://api-doc.qovery.com/#tag/Containers/operation/autoDeployContainerEnvironments
- Lifecycle job / cronjob: https://api-doc.qovery.com/#tag/Jobs/operation/autoDeployJobEnvironments
