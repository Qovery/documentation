Qovery lets you quickly deploy applications to your [Amazon Web Services (AWS)][urls.aws] account. No knowledge needed, and it takes less than 20 minutes to install Qovery on your AWS account.

<Alert type="info">

Do you want to know more about how Qovery works on your AWS account? [Here][docs.useful-resources.faq#how-qovery-works-under-the-hood] is explained how Qovery works under the hood.

## Getting started

<Assumptions>

* You have a [Qovery][docs.using-qovery.interface] account
* You have created an [Organization][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization]
* You have an AWS account

</Assumptions>

### Connect your AWS account

To link your AWS account to Qovery you need to provide an AWS `access key id` and `secret access key` with the [required IAM permissions][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.amazon-web-services].

<Alert type="info">

You can link more than one AWS account. Qovery also support multiple Cloud providers within the same Organization. Meaning, you can balance your workload on different Cloud providers. [Read more][guides.advanced].

</Alert>

#### Create your AWS credentials - `access key id` and `secret access key`

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

<li>

[Connect to your AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com)

</li>

<li>

Go to `My Security Credentials`
<img src="/img/aws-my-security-credentials.png" />

</li>

<li>

Create `Admins` group **without any permissions**

<Alert type="warning">

The name of the group MUST be Admins. If you use another name, this will not work

</Alert>


<img src="/img/aws-create-group-1.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-group-2.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-group-3.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-group-4.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

Create one IAM user called `qovery`.
<img src="/img/aws-create-user-1.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-user-2.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-create-user-3.jpg" />

Go to the last step and copy your `access key id` and `secret access key`.

<img src="/img/aws-create-user-4.jpg" />

</li>

<li>


Setup<a href="/files/qovery-iam-aws.json"> IAM permissions</a> to the `qovery` user.

<Alert type="warning">

<a href="/files/qovery-iam-aws.json">Download IAM permissions JSON</a>

Or copy it from below:


```json
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:*",

                "s3:*",
                "tag:GetResources"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ],
    "Version": "2012-10-17"
}
```

</Alert>

**Then, follow the arrows in AWS console to create AWS credentials with required IAM permissions:**

<img src="/img/aws-add-policy-1.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-add-policy-2.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-add-policy-3.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws-add-policy-4.jpg" />

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

Well done!! You now have your AWS `access key id` and `secret access key` and your permissions are setups; It is time to connect Qovery to your AWS account.

#### Install a new cluster on Qovery

You will be able to use the credentials you just generated when creating a cluster via the Qovery console. This cluster will be linked to your Qovery organization.
Follow these steps to create a new cluster. 

<Steps headingDepth={3}>

<ol>

<li>

Go to your organizations settings.
<img src="/img/organization-setting.png" />

</li>

<li>

On this page, you will be able to see the information and status or your clusters. 

Click on `Add cluster` button.  

<img src="/img/add-cluster.png" />

</li>

<li>

A modal is displayed, where you can specify the name of your cluster and the Cloud Provider. 

Select the following Cloud Provider: `Amazon Web Services`.

Once you have selected the cloud provider, you will be able to define the Region of your Cluster. 

<img src="/img/aws-select-provider.png" />

</li>


<li>

Here you can choose to set your cluster credentials straight away or later. To set them now, select the `Do you want to set credentials?` option.

If you have already set credentials on another cluster, they have been linked to your Qovery account and can be reused here. Just click on the one you want to use in the drop-down list.

If you want to use other credentials (or if you do not have any defined), click `+ new credentials` in the drop-down list. 

<img src="/img/aws-config-creds.png" />

</li>

<li>

A new modal pops up where you can specify the `Name of the certificate`, the `Access key identifier` and the `Secret access key`.

<img src="/img/aws-new-creds.png" />

Click on `Save`to save the new credential and then `Next`.

</li>

<li>

On this step, you can select specific features you want to activate or deactivate on the cluster. 

<img src="/img/cluster-features.png" />

<Alert type="warning">

You will not be able to activate/deactivate these features once the cluster has been deployed for the first time.

</Alert>

</li>

<li>

Once your new cluster is created, it will be listed in the cluster list. If you have finished configuring your cluster, click on the `...` and `Install` menu to start the cluster installation. 

<img src="/img/install-cluster.png" />

</li>

<li>

Your cluster is now installing and will be ready in the coming 20 minutes!

<img src="/img/installing-cluster.png" />

</li>

</ol>

### Remove your AWS account

*this section is under development - [join us][urls.qovery_chat] and be part of the first to try it*

### Delete Qovery from your AWS account

<Alert type="warning">

Your applications and your data will be deleted.

</Alert>

To delete Qovery from your AWS account you must be the owner of the Organization.
Once your AWS account removed from Qovery, everything configured (VPC, Kubernetes, ...) by Qovery will be deleted forever.

### IAM permissions

Qovery required IAM permissions to create, update and managed the infrastructure.

- IAM is used to create IAM roles
- S3 is used to store our generated configuration files
- Cloudwatch, for creating a group stream for each Kubernetes clusters
- Autoscaling for RDS and autoscaling rules for the Kubernetes cluster
- Elastic load-balancing for ELB / ALB / NLB.
- DynamoDB to have a distributed lock on infrastructure deployment.
- ECR for managing the container registry, create/update/delete repository.
- KMS to load and store keys (RDS, SSH, …)
- EKS to create and update the Kubernetes cluster.

## Regions

Qovery supports regions where [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks) is supported.

## Manually configure VPC subnet

VPC subnet is automatically defined by Qovery on cluster creation. However, you may want to choose your own VPC subnet, for example to perform VPC Peering. 

<Alert type="info">

If you want to perform VPC Peering with Qovery, please refer to our guide [VPC Peering with Qovery][guides.tutorial.aws-vpc-peering-with-qovery] to be assisted step by step. 

</Alert>

During the adding of a new cluster in your organization, you will have the opportunity to choose and set up the features of your cluster. In this list of features, you can activate the `VPC subnet` feature and choose in the drop-down menu the subnet you want to use. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/cluster-vpc-subnet.png" alt="VPC subnet cluster" />
</p>

<Alert type="warning">

You will not be able to activate/deactivate these features once the cluster has been deployed for the first time.

</Alert>

## Configure routing table

You may want to create and edit a network routing table to perform VPC peering. This can be done by accessing to the parameters of a cluster, in the settings of your organization. 

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>
<li>

Go in the settings of your organization.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/organization-setting.png" alt="Organization setting" />

## How Qovery works on AWS

Qovery is an abstraction layer on top of AWS and Kubernetes. Qovery manages the configuration of AWS account, and helps you to deploy production ready apps in seconds.
To make it works, Qovery rely on Kubernetes for stateless apps (containers), and  AWS for stateful apps (databases, storage...).

[Read more][docs.getting-started.how-qovery-works] on how Qovery works behind the scene.

### Kubernetes

The first time you set up your AWS account, Qovery creates a Kubernetes cluster in your chosen region. Qovery managed it for you - no action required. It takes ~15 minutes to configure and bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. Once bootstrapped, your Kubernetes cluster runs the Qovery app and is ready to deploy your applications.

### Managed services

AWS provides managed services for [PostgreSQL][docs.using-qovery.configuration.database.postgresql], [MySQL][docs.using-qovery.configuration.database.mysql], [Redis][docs.using-qovery.configuration.database.redis], [MongoDB][docs.using-qovery.configuration.database.mongodb]. Qovery gives you access to those services when you set the [environment mode][docs.using-qovery.configuration.deployment-rule#environment-deployment-rules] to `Production`. In `Development` mode, Qovery provides containers equivalent, which is cheaper and faster to start.

### Security and compliance

Qovery runs your Kubernetes cluster and is autonomous to manage your applications, which means:
- Your configuration are stored on your AWS account.
- Your configuration is encrypted on your AWS account.
- Qovery can't access to your data.
- Suppose Qovery stops to run, your applications are not impacted.

## FAQ

### How to choose a region?

Different datacenters are located in different geographic areas, and you may want to keep your site physically close to the bulk of your user base for reduced latency.

### I don't find a region that is provided by AWS

We are probably testing the support of this region, please [contact us][urls.qovery_contact_us] to know what's the status

### Migrate between Cloud providers and regions

Today, you can't migrate an environment from one region to another after it has been created. Vote [here][urls.qovery_roadmap] if you need this feature.
