[Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com?ref=qovery) (SCW) is a platform that offers flexible, reliable, and scalable Cloud computing solutions. The platform is developed with a combination of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings.

> [Qovery][urls.qovery] is the simplest way to deploy your apps on Scaleway.

In this tutorial, I will explain step by step how to deploy your app on Scaleway in 10 minutes. No Scaleway/infrastructure/Cloud knowledge required - no kidding!

## Before you start

1. This tutorial is perfect for anyone interested into deploying their apps on Scaleway seamlessly.
2. If you have any question or suggestion on this tutorial, please contact us via [this form][urls.qovery_contact_us] or [Discord][urls.qovery_chat].

### What is Qovery
Qovery is a platform that makes your app deployment on Scaleway very simple. The installation of Qovery on your Scaleway account takes approximately 10 minutes. Then you're ready to deploy your apps "à la" Heroku-like..

### Why you should use Scaleway
* You want to use a European Cloud provider 🇪🇺.
* You want to stay focus on what you are building.
* You need to speed up your Go-To-Market and Product Market Fit.
* You are looking for a cheapest alternative to AWS.

### Why you should not use Scaleway
* You need to host your applications outside of Europe.
* You need to use MongoDB in production. (They do not have managed MongoDB).
* You need any specific AWS, GCP or Azure services.

Let's start!

# Install Qovery on Scaleway
## Create a Scaleway account

*If you already have a Scaleway account, you can go to the next point.*

Before creating a Scaleway account, I'd recommend contacting Scaleway to see if you are eligible to free credits. Which is convenient to have at the beginning of a project. If you know that you are not eligible, you can create your account by clicking on the top right button `Create an Scaleway Account` of their [main page](https://www.scaleway.com?ref=qovery).

### Get your Scaleway API keys

<Alert type="info">

Follow [this guide][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.scaleway] to create your Scaleway credentials

</Alert>

To install Qovery on your Scaleway account, the `project id`, `secret access key` and `access key id` are required. Here is a comprehensive [step-by-step guide][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.scaleway] on how to generate your `secret access key` and `access key id`. If you already have those keys, then you can go to the next point.

## Configure Qovery

### Sign-up to Qovery
Using Qovery is as simple as connect with your *Github*, *Gitlab* or *Bitbucket* account on [console.qovery.com][urls.start_qovery].

-> [Connect to Qovery][urls.start_qovery]

### Create your Organization

<Alert type="info">

You can skip this step if you already have an Organization.

</Alert>

An organization is a shared account where developers can collaborate across many projects at once. Owners and organization administrators can manage:
- Cloud accounts.
- Members access.
- Billing.

[Read more][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization] about Organizations

To deploy on your Scaleway account, you have to choose between **Free**, **Professional** and **Business** plan for your organization.

### Install Qovery on your Scaleway account

1/ Go to your organization settings by clicking on the "cog" icon next to your organization name.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/organization_settings_clusters_empty.jpg" alt="Go your organization settings > clusters" />
</p>

2/ Create a cluster, select *Scaleway* and the region where you want to deploy your apps.

<Alert type="success">

Choose a region close to where your users will use your applications to have better performances.

</Alert>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/organization_settings_create_cluster.jpg" alt="Create a cluster" />
</p>

3/ Set your Scaleway credentials. (Check out [this guide][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.scaleway] if you have no Scaleway credentials).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/organization_settings_add_credentials.jpg" alt="Set your cloud credentials" />
</p>

4/ Under the hood, Qovery uses a managed Kubernetes ([Scaleway Kapsule](https://www.scaleway.com/en/kubernetes-kapsule/)) to run your applications. You need to specify the CPU and RAM you want per node, and the min/max number of nodes. Qovery will keep low the number of nodes and will only scale up your nodes if your applications really need to scale.

<Alert type="success">

Qovery optimizes and keep your Scaleway costs low.

</Alert>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/organization_settings_cluster_resources.jpg" alt="Set your cluster resources" />
</p>

<Alert type="info">
Qovery might use some temporary free resources on your Kubernetes cluster to perform spotted maintenance operations (e.g. : cluster version upgrades).
This is why we recommend a cluster setup with:
<ul>
  <li>at least 20% difference between the minimum and the maximum number of nodes;</li>
  <li>at least 5 nodes as the maximum number of nodes of your cluster;</li>
</ul>
</Alert>

5/ Click on **Save** and **Deploy**.
