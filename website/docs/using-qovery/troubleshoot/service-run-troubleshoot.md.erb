Within this section you will find the common errors you might encounter when running your services with Qovery



## My app is crashing, how do I connect to investigate?

**Goal: You want to connect to your container's application to debug your application**

First, try to use `qovery shell` command from the [Qovery CLI][docs.using-qovery.interface.cli#shell]. It's a safe method to connect to your container and debug your application.

If your app is crashing in the first seconds, you'll lose the connection to your container, making the debug almost impossible, then continue reading.

<Alert type="danger">

You can apply this procedure directly on your application OR on a copy having the same setup.
If you don't make a copy, doing this procedure directly on the **PRODUCTION** application will lead to a downtime in your service. Be sure of what you're doing before going ahead!

</Alert>

Your app is crashing very quickly, here is how to keep the full control of your container:

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

<li>

[Temporary delete the application port from your application configuration][docs.using-qovery.configuration.application#ports]. This to avoid Kubernetes to restart the container when the port is not open.

</li>
<li>

Into your Dockerfile, comment your `EXEC` or `ENTRYPOINT` and add a way to make your container sleep. For example:
```bash
#CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
CMD ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]
```

Commit and push your changes to trigger a new deployment (trigger it manually from the Qovery console if it's not the case).

</li>
<li>

Once the deployment done, you can use [qovery shell][docs.using-qovery.interface.cli#shell] command to connect to your container and debug.

<Alert type="success">

Once you've finished debugging, **remember to configure your application port back**. It's mandatory to avoid downtimes during application releases.

</ol>
