## FAQ

### I don't find my Monitoring provider, what should I do?

Basically, Qovery relies on Kubernetes to run your apps. Meaning, Qovery will support your monitoring solution if their maintainers provide a [Helm Chart][urls.helm].

If your monitoring platform provides a Helm Chart, then you can install it:

### By deploying the helm chart with Qovery

1. Follow [this guide][docs.using-qovery.configuration.helm] to deploy your Helm Chart with Qovery.

### By using kubectl

1. [Connect to your Qovery Kubernetes cluster][guides.tutorial.how-to-connect-to-your-eks-cluster-with-kubectl].
2. Install the helm chart.

Helm is a Kubernetes package manager.
