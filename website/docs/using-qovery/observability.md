Qovery provides built-in **observability** to help you monitor, analyze, and troubleshoot your applications and infrastructure.  
With observability enabled, you gain deep visibility into the **health, performance, and behavior** of your services directly from the Qovery console.

## How to access this feature?

Currently this feature is not in self-service, if you’d like to get access to this feature, please reach out to us by contacting us on Slack. 


<Alert type="info">

Currently, observability is available on **AWS clusters** only. Support for **Scaleway, GCP, and Azure** is coming soon.

## What is included?

- **Service health checks** to understand how your applications behave in real time.  
- **Metrics** such as CPU, memory, and network usage per service.  
- **Logs** with up to 90 days of retention for troubleshooting.  
- **Events** from both Qovery and Kubernetes (e.g. deployments, scaling events, pod failures).  

Observability helps you answer key questions such as:  

- *Is my service healthy?*  
- *Why is my application consuming more resources than expected?*  
- *What errors occurred during deployment or runtime?*  
- *How do requests behave over time (latency, error rates, throughput)?*

## Why Choose Qovery’s Built-in Observability

Today, engineering teams face three main options when it comes to observability:

1. Third-party SaaS tools (e.g. Datadog)

    SaaS monitoring platforms are powerful and feature-rich, but they come with two significant drawbacks:

    * Data leaves your infrastructure, which may raise compliance, security, or cost concerns.

    * Weak correlation with your deployed services on Qovery. You end up switching contexts between your deployment platform and your monitoring tool, making troubleshooting slower and more complex.

2. Do-it-yourself (DIY) stack

    You can build and maintain your own observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, Jaeger…). This offers flexibility, but it requires:

    * Dedicated expertise to set up and operate.

    * Heavy ongoing maintenance of upgrades, scaling, storage, and integrations.

    * High customization overhead before you get something usable across your environments.

3. Qovery Built-in Observability

    With Qovery, you get the best of both worlds:

    * Data stays in your infrastructure for compliance and security.

    * Zero maintenance — we manage the observability stack for you.

    * Correlated metrics and logs, directly linked to your deployed services, clusters, and environments.

    * Developer + Ops friendly UX, so your team can quickly identify and resolve issues without juggling multiple tools.
