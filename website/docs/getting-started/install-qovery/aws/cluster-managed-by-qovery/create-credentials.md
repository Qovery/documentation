This guide will help you to create your Amazon Web Services (AWS) credentials for Qovery. Those credentials will be used to create a Kubernetes cluster, a dedicated VPC and a few services on your AWS account. Refer to our [Infrastructure][docs.getting-started.install-qovery.aws.cluster-managed-by-qovery.infrastructure] page to learn more about the infrastructure created by Qovery.

<Assumptions>

* You have an AWS account

## Generate AWS credentials

We support two authentication methods for AWS: Assume Role via STS and Static Credentials (Access Key & Secret Access Key).

For security reasons, we strongly recommend using Assume Role via STS. Static credentials are long-lived and more exposed to leaks, while Assume Role provides short-lived, automatically refreshed credentials with granular access control, reducing security risks.

<Tabs
  centered={true}
  className={"rounded"}
  defaultValue={"Assume role via STS (preferred)"}
  placeholder="Select your credentials"
  select={false}
  size={null}
  values={[{"group":"Credentials","label":"Assume role via STS (preferred)","value":"Assume role via STS (preferred)"},{"group":"Credentials","label":"Static credentials","value":"Static credentials"}]}>

<TabItem value="Assume role via STS (preferred)">

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

<li>

[Connect to your AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com). Make sure you are connected to the right AWS account.

</li>

<li>

Execute the following [Cloudformation stack](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/quickcreate?templateURL=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fcloudformation-qovery-role-creation%2Ftemplate.json&stackName=qovery-role-creation
), make sure you select the checkbox `I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names`


It will create a role for Qovery and grant assume role permissions (see the [cloudformation stack content here](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-qovery-role-creation/template.json), including the role permissions)

</li>

<li>

Retrieve the role ARN from the `Outputs`section.

</li>

<li>

Insert the role ARN in Qovery and provide a credentials name to identify it in the Qovery console.

</li>
</ol>
</Steps>

<TabItem value="Static credentials">

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

<li>

[Connect to your AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com)

</li>

<li>

Go to `IAM`
<img src="/img/aws/aws-my-security-credentials.png" />

</li>

<li>

Create one IAM user called `qovery`.

<img src="/img/aws/create-user-2.png" />
<img src="/img/aws/create-user-3.png" />

</li>

<li>


Setup<a href="/files/qovery-iam-aws.json"> IAM permissions</a> to the `qovery` user.

Or copy it from below:

				"arn:aws:sqs:*:*:qovery*",
				"arn:aws:sqs:*:*:qovery*/*"
			]
		}
	]
}
```

</Alert>

**Then, follow the arrows in AWS console to create AWS credentials with required IAM permissions:**

<img src="/img/aws/aws-add-policy-1.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws/aws-add-policy-2.png" />
<img src="/img/aws/aws-add-policy-3.jpg" />
<img src="/img/aws/aws-add-policy-4.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

To create an `access key id` and `secret access key`, go to the Security Credentials tab of the `Qovery` user and press `Create access key`

<img src="/img/aws/aws-create-credentials-1.png" />
<img src="/img/aws/aws-create-credentials-2.png" />
<img src="/img/aws/aws-create-credentials-3.png" />

You can now save the `access key id` and `secret access key`
<img src="/img/aws/aws-create-credentials-4.png" />

</li>
</ol>

</Steps>

Well done!! You now have your AWS `access key id` and `secret access key` and your permissions are setups; It is time to connect Qovery to your AWS account.

You can also view the complete list of all your cloud credentials at the organization level,  ([More info here][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.cloud-credentials]).

### Install a new cluster on Qovery

You will be able to use the credentials you just generated when creating a cluster via the Qovery console. This cluster will be linked to your Qovery organization.
Follow [this documentation][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#creating-a-cluster] to create a new cluster on your organization.

## Next steps

Now you can use your AWS account to deploy your applications on Qovery. You can also link other Cloud providers to your organization.
