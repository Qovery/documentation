## Resources

Here are some resources you can use to reduce your cloud cost with Qovery.

### Deployment rules

Deployment rules allows you to start and stop environments at a given time. Stopping dev environments outside of your working hours is a great way to reduce your cloud bills.
You can find more information on Deployment rules in [our documentation](https://hub.qovery.com/docs/using-qovery/configuration/deployment-rule/)

### Karpenter

Here at Qovery we have worked to integrate Karpenter with our product. Karpenter is an orchestrator for Kubernetes. Only available on AWS. You can find more information on Karpenter and Qovery integration on [our blog](https://www.qovery.com/blog/installing-karpenter-lessons-learned-from-our-experience/).

### Kubecost

Kubecost provides real-time cost visibility and insights on your Kubernetes cluster. [Qovery partnered with Kubecost](https://www.qovery.com/blog/kubecost-and-qovery-team-up-to-offer-cost-monitoring-for-devops-teams/) to help customers monitor their spendings in the cloud. We also have a guide on [how to deploy Kubecost on your cluster](https://hub.qovery.com/guides/tutorial/monitor-and-reduce-kubernetes-spend-with-kubecost/).
