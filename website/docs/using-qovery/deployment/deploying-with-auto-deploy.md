Once you have configured your services and deployed them for the first time, you can decide to automatically update the applications to the latest version of your git branch thanks to the auto-deploy feauture.

Each time a commit is pushed on your git repository, Qovery receives a webhook call containing the commit information (who did it, what changed, which branch etc..). Thanks to this information, Qovery is able to determine which application should be automatically re-deployed with the new version.

## How to activate it

The auto-deploy feature can be activated from the application settings, by switching on the auto-deploy flag.

</p>

It can also be activated on the first step of the service creation flow

  <img src="/img/deployment/auto-deploy-creation-flow.png" alt="Auto-deploy creation flow" />
</p>

Once this flag is activated, every new commit pushed on the branch of the application will trigger an automatic deployment of the new version.


## Auto-deploy and container images

The auto-deploy feature can be activated as well if you directly deploy your container images but it requires some additional integration via your CI/CD. Your CI/CD has to inform Qovery that a new version of the image (a new tag) is available for a specific container image. Thanks to this information, Qovery can find any application that uses this container image and automatically trigger a deployment of the new image tag.

To inform Qovery of the new version, your CI/CD needs to call the following endpoints, depending on the service type:
- Container: https://api-doc.qovery.com/#tag/Containers/operation/autoDeployContainerEnvironments
- Lifecycle job / cronjob: https://api-doc.qovery.com/#tag/Jobs/operation/autoDeployJobEnvironments
