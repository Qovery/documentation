Install Qovery on your [Scaleway][urls.scaleway] account in less than 20 minutes. Qovery will create a Kubernetes cluster for you and manage it for you. To install Qovery on an existing Kubernetes cluster, please refer to the [dedicated documentation][docs.getting-started.install-qovery.scaleway.cluster-managed-by-qovery].

<Assumptions>

* You have an account and an [Organization][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization] on Qovery
* You have an Scaleway account

</Assumptions>

Note that you can create multiple clusters on the same Scaleway account with different VPCs. You can also create multiple clusters on different Scaleway accounts. Qovery will manage them for you.

## Select your options

Qovery propose multiple options that you can select to customize your installation. You can also change some of them later. Refer to this [guide][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters.scaleway] for more details on the available configurations.

## Attach Scaleway credentials

Follow this [guide][docs.getting-started.install-qovery.scaleway.cluster-managed-by-qovery.create-credentials] to create your Scaleway credentials.

## Install Qovery

Click on `Create and Deploy` to create the cluster and install Qovery on it.

It will take up to 20 minutes to create the cluster, VPC and install Qovery on it. But you can already [configure your first application][guides.getting-started.deploy-your-first-application].

You should see your new cluster in the list of clusters.
