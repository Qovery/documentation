In addition to real-time monitoring, Qovery observability includes **logs** to help you understand what happened in your applications.  

## Service Logs

Every service in Qovery has its own log stream, collected and stored via **Loki + Promtail**. (See the [Logs Section][docs.using-qovery.deployment.logs] to know more)

- **Full historical access**: Complete log history with 12 weeks retention when observability is enabled
- Logs are enriched with **Qovery-specific labels** such as service ID and environment ID for easier filtering  
- Error-level logs are automatically detected and counted, making it easy to correlate metrics with log spikes

* Click on the scroll icon next to the error logs to jump into the Service Logs view
* The logs interface will already be filtered on the right service, severity, and selected time range
