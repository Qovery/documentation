```bash title="Clone your forked application"
# Change <your_name> with your Github account name
$ git clone git@github.com:<your_name>/simple-example-node.git
```

Qovery has deployed the application, to get the deployment status:

```bash
# Move into the directory
$ cd simple-example-node

# Show the deployment status
$ qovery status
```

Here is the output you should have. Is it not the case? [Contact us on our forum][urls.qovery_forum]

```bash
BRANCH NAME | STATUS  | ENDPOINTS          | APPLICATIONS        | DATABASES
master      | running | https://domain.tld | simple-example-node | none

APPLICATION NAME    | STATUS  | DATABASES
simple-example-node | running | none
```

Voil√† ! Your first templated app has been successfully deployed
