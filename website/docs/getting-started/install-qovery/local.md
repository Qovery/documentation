## Purpose and Limitations

It's important to note that this local setup of Qovery using the `qovery demo up` command is designed for demonstration and testing purposes only. It is not intended for production use. Please refer to other guides for production-grade installations.

## Requirements

- **Supported Operating Systems**: Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
- **Resources**: 4 CPU and 8GB of RAM for your Docker runtime.
- **Binaries**: [docker][urls.docker], jq, curl, sed, grep, git.
- A stable Internet connection.

## Installation

To install Qovery on your local machine, follow these steps:

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

<li>

Install Qovery CLI by running the following command:

<Tabs
  centered={true}
  className={"rounded"}
  defaultValue={"linux"}
  placeholder="Select your OS"
  select={false}
  size={null}
  values={[{"group":"Platforms","label":"Linux","value":"linux"},{"group":"Platforms","label":"MacOS","value":"macos"},{"group":"Platforms","label":"Windows","value":"windows"},{"group": "Platforms","label":"Docker","value":"docker"}]}>

<TabItem value="linux">

<Tabs
  centered={true}
  className="rounded"
  defaultValue="universal"
  values={[{"label":"*nix","value":"universal"},{"label":"Arch Linux","value":"arch"},{"label":"Manual","value":"manual"}]}>

<TabItem value="universal">

To download and install Qovery CLI on any Linux distribution:
```bash
$ curl -s https://get.qovery.com | bash
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="arch">

Qovery is part of [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages) packages, so you can install it with [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay):

```bash
$ yay qovery-cli
```

<TabItem value="manual">

Install the Qovery CLI on Linux manually by downloading the [latest release][urls.qovery_cli_releases], and uncompress its content to a folder into your shell `PATH`.

  className="rounded"
  defaultValue="homebrew"
  values={[{"label":"Homebrew","value":"homebrew"},{"label":"Script","value":"script"},{"label":"Manual","value":"manual"}]}>

<TabItem value="homebrew">

The common solution to install a command line binary on the MacOS is to use [Homebrew][urls.brew].

```bash
# Add Qovery brew repository
$ brew tap Qovery/qovery-cli

# Install the CLI
$ brew install qovery-cli
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="script">

To download and install Qovery CLI from the command line:
```bash
$ curl -s https://get.qovery.com | bash
```

  className="rounded"
  defaultValue="scoop"
  values={[{"label":"Scoop","value":"scoop"},{"label":"Manual","value":"manual"}]}>

<TabItem value="scoop">

The classic way to install binaries on Windows is to use [Scoop][urls.scoop].

```bash
# Add Qovery bucket
$ scoop bucket add qovery https://github.com/Qovery/scoop-qovery-cli

# Install the CLI
$ scoop install qovery-cli
```

</TabItem>


<TabItem value="docker">

Install Docker on your local machine and run the following command:

```bash
# Pull and Run the latest Qovery CLI
$ docker run ghcr.io/qovery/qovery-cli:latest help
```

Change `latest` by the version you want to use. For example, to use the version 0.58.4, run:

```bash
$ docker run ghcr.io/qovery/qovery-cli:0.58.4 help
```

Note: `ghcr.io` is the [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-cli/pkgs/container/qovery-cli).

Authenticate with Qovery by running the following command:

```bash
# Sign up and sign in command
$ qovery auth
```

<Alert type="info">

If you are using a headless (without GUI) environment, you can use the following command to sign up and sign in:

```bash
# Sign up and sign in command
$ qovery auth --headless
```

</Alert>

Your browser window with Qovery sign-up page will open. Follow the instructions to sign up and sign in.

</li>

<li>

Set Qovery context:

```bash

qovery context set

```

</li>

<li>

Start the Qovery demo by running the following command:

<Alert type="warning">

Ensure you have [Docker][urls.docker] running and that you have installed jq, curl, sed, grep, and git.

</Alert>

```bash

qovery demo up

```

A k3s Kubernetes cluster will be installed on your local machine and Qovery will be installed on top of it.

Note that if you are on MacOS or Windows, you might be prompted for your admin password - which is necessary to properly route the traffic from your host to your k3s apps.

```shell
...
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Configure network
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
+ sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 172.42.0.3/32 up
Password:
...
```

At the end of the installation, you will see the following message:

```shell
...

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Qovery demo cluster is now installed !!!!
The kubeconfig is correctly set, so you can connect to it directly with kubectl or k9s from your local machine
To delete/stop/start your cluster, use k3d cluster xxxx

Go to https://console.qovery.com to create your first environment on this cluster 'hello-local-cluster'
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
```

</li>

<li>

Access the Qovery dashboard by visiting [console.qovery.com][urls.qovery_console].

</li>

</ol>
</Steps>

Well done, you have successfully installed Qovery on your local machine. You can now start deploying your applications and experience the Qovery experience.

## Cleanup your local environment

To clean up your local environment, run the following command:

```bash

qovery demo destroy

```

That's it! You have successfully removed the Qovery demo cluster from your local machine.
