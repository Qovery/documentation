<Alert type="success">

Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with [Terraform][docs.using-qovery.integration.terraform] and our [REST API][docs.using-qovery.interface.rest-api] to manage Qovery and deploy your apps.

</Alert>

Qovery provides a [management console][urls.start_qovery] which allows you to interact with your projects and manage your environments.

## First sign-up

<%= qovery_sign_up_web() %>

<Alert type="info">

If you log in with the Google or Microsoft providers you will have to setup a git token to access and deploy your applications from your private repositories. 

For more information, see [Managing Git Permissions with the Git Tokens][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.git-repository-access].

</Alert>

## Deploy your first application

Now that you have signed up on the web interface, check out [how to deploy your first application][guides.deploy-your-first-application]
