[Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?ref=qovery) (DO) is a platform that offers flexible, reliable, and scalable Cloud computing solutions. The platform is developed with a combination of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings.

> [Qovery][urls.qovery] is the simplest way to deploy your apps on Digital Ocean.

In this tutorial, I will explain step by step how to deploy your app on Digital Ocean in 20 minutes. No Digital Ocean/infrastructure/Cloud knowledge required - no kidding!

### What is Qovery
Qovery is a platform that makes your app deployment on Digital Ocean very simple. The installation of Qovery on your Digital Ocean account takes approximately 20 minutes. Then you're ready to deploy your apps "a la" Heroku-like. [Read more about Qovery][docs.getting-started.what-is-qovery].

### Why you should use Digital Ocean
* You want to use a Global Cloud provider 🌎.
* You want to stay focus on what you are building.
* You need to speed up your Go-To-Market and Product Market Fit.
* You are looking for a cheapest alternative to AWS.

### Why you should not use Digital Ocean
* You need any specific AWS, GCP or Azure services.

Let's start!

# Install Qovery on Digital Ocean
## Create a Digital Ocean account

*If you already have a Digital Ocean account, you can go to the next point.*

Before creating a Digital Ocean account, I'd recommend contacting Digital Ocean to see if you are eligible to free credits. Which is convenient to have at the beginning of a project. If you know that you are not eligible, you can create your account by clicking on the top right button `Create an Digital Ocean Account` of their [main page](https://www.digitalocean.com?ref=qovery).

### Get your Digital Ocean API keys

<Alert type="info">

Follow [this guide][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.digital-ocean] to create your Digital Ocean credentials

</Alert>

To install Qovery on your Digital Ocean account, the `project id`, `secret access key` and `access key id` are required. Here is a comprehensive [step-by-step guide][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.digital-ocean] on how to generate your `secret access key` and `access key id`. If you already have those keys, then you can go to the next point.

## Configure Qovery

### Sign-up to Qovery
Using Qovery is as simple as connect with your *GitHub*, *Gitlab* or *Bitbucket* account on [console.qovery.com][urls.start_qovery].

-> [Connect to Qovery][urls.start_qovery]

### Create your Organization

<Alert type="info">

You can skip this step if you already have an Organization.

</Alert>

An organization is a shared account where developers can collaborate across many projects at once. Owners and organization administrators can manage:
- Cloud accounts.
- Members access.
- Billing.

[Read more][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization] about Organizations

To deploy on your Digital Ocean account, you have to choose between **Free**, **Professional** and **Business** plan for your organization.

</p>

### Install Qovery on your Digital Ocean account

1/ Go to your organization settings by clicking on the "cog" icon next to your organization name.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/organization_settings_clusters_empty.jpg" alt="Go your organization settings > clusters" />
</p>

2/ Create a cluster, select *Digital Ocean*, and the region where you want to deploy your apps.

<Alert type="success">

Choose a region close to where your users will use your applications to have better performances.

</Alert>

  <img src="/img/organization_settings_create_cluster.jpg" alt="Create a cluster" />
</p>

3/ Set your Digital Ocean credentials. (Check out [this guide][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.digital-ocean] if you have no Digital Ocean credentials).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/organization_settings_add_credentials.jpg" alt="Set your cloud credentials" />
</p>

4/ Under the hood, Qovery uses a managed Digital Ocean [Kubernetes](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/) to run your applications. You need to specify the CPU and RAM you want per node, and the min/max number of nodes. Qovery will keep low the number of nodes and will only scale up your nodes if your applications really need to scale.

<Alert type="success">

Qovery optimizes and keep your Digital Ocean costs low.

</Alert>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/organization_settings_cluster_resources.jpg" alt="Set your cluster resources" />
</p>

<Alert type="info">
Qovery might use some temporary free resources on your Kubernetes cluster to perform spotted maintenance operations (e.g. : cluster version upgrades). 
This is why we recommend a cluster setup with:
<ul>
  <li>at least 20% difference between the minimum and the maximum number of nodes;</li>
  <li>at least 5 nodes as the maximum number of nodes of your cluster;</li>
</ul>
</Alert>

5/ Click on **Save** and **Deploy**.

Congrats! Qovery will be installed within 20 minutes 🎉. You will be notified when it is all good.
In the meantime, you can take a look at our [guide section][guides.getting-started].

## Deploy your application
Once Qovery is installed on your Digital Ocean account, you have the possibility to deploy your application. Take a look to [our guide][guides.getting-started] on how to [deploy your first application][guides.getting-started.deploy-your-first-application] with Qovery.
