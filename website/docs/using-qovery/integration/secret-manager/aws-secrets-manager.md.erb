AWS Secrets Manager is a service that helps you protect secrets needed to access your applications, services, and IT resources. The service enables you to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle.

To provide better integration with Qovery - we recommend using AWS Secrets Manager with Doppler. Doppler ease the synchronization of AWS Secrets Manager with Qovery. You can find more information about Doppler and Qovery integration [here][docs.using-qovery.integration.secret-manager.doppler].

## Setup

### API Keys

<Alert type="warning">

We highly recommend using [Assume Roles](#assume-roles) instead of API Keys.

</Alert>

If your applications need to use AWS Secrets Manager with API Keys, you need to add your API Key in [Qovery Secrets Manager][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment-variable#create-an-environment-variable].

Then you can use it in your application as a regular environment variable.

### Assume Roles

Follow [this guide][guides.tutorial.use-aws-iam-roles-with-qovery] to get assume roles on your Kubernetes cluster. Once it is set up, your application will be able to connect to AWS Secrets Manager using the AWS SDK.
