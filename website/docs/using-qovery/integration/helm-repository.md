Qovery allows you to integrate with major helm registries, enabling you to deploy your own helm charts or those available on public registries.

You can control the helm registry used by your teams directly within the [Qovery Console][urls.qovery_console]. 

To know more about how to configure your helm registry connection and the supported container registries, have a look at [this section][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.helm-repository]
