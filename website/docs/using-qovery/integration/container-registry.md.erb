Qovery allows you to integrate with major container registries, enabling you to deploy your own container images or those available on public registries.

You can control the container registry used by your teams directly within the [Qovery Console][urls.qovery_console]. 

To know more about how to configure your container registry connection and the supported container registries, have a look at [this section][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.container-registry]
