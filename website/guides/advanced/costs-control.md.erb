## Resources

Here are some resources you can use to reduce your cloud cost with Qovery.

### Deployment rules

Deployment rules allows you to start and stop environments at a given time. Stopping dev environments outside of your working hours is a great way to reduce your cloud bills.
You can find more information on Deployment rules in [our documentation](https://hub.qovery.com/docs/using-qovery/configuration/deployment-rule/)

### Karpenter

To optimize efficiency and reduce costs for your nodes on AWS EKS clusters, you can enable the Karpenter autoscaler. For a deeper dive into Karpenter and its integration with Qovery, check out [our blog](https://www.qovery.com/blog/installing-karpenter-lessons-learned-from-our-experience/). Detailed instructions on enabling Karpenter are available in [our documentation](https://hub.qovery.com/docs/using-qovery/configuration/clusters/#managing-your-clusters-with-qovery).

### Kubecost

Kubecost provides real-time cost visibility and insights on your Kubernetes cluster. [Qovery partnered with Kubecost](https://www.qovery.com/blog/kubecost-and-qovery-team-up-to-offer-cost-monitoring-for-devops-teams/) to help customers monitor their spendings in the cloud. We also have a guide on [how to deploy Kubecost on your cluster](https://hub.qovery.com/guides/tutorial/monitor-and-reduce-kubernetes-spend-with-kubecost/).
