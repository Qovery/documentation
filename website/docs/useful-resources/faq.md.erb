## What is the difference between a Project, an Application, and an Environment?

A [project][docs.using-qovery.configuration.project] is the site that you're working on. Each project can contain multiple [applications][docs.using-qovery.configuration.application] and be deployed in multiple [environments][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment]. An environment is a standalone copy of your site, including apps, databases, storage, data, and all other services. By default, `main` branch is the production environment, while all other branches can be set up as identical copies of the prod environment for testing purposes.

## How does application build works?

Basically, Qovery deploys your application as a container. Check out the detailed explanation of what is going on behind the scene [here][docs.getting-started.how-qovery-works#application-and-database-deployment]

## How does Qovery manage databases?

Qovery provides `managed` and `container` modes for your databases. Basically, `managed` mode relies on the managed database provided by the cloud provider. E.g. if you choose `Postgres` with the `managed` mode while your environment is running on AWS, then Qovery provides an [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds) instance. Please check out our [database section][docs.using-qovery.configuration.database] for further details.

## Does Qovery replace Kubernetes?

Behind the scene, Qovery uses [Kubernetes][urls.kubernetes]. Qovery extends Kubernetes to make it accessible to any developer teams.
Important: Qovery does not modify Kubernetes. It only deploys his services in a `qovery` Kubernetes namespace.

## Does Qovery support mono repository?

Yes, absolutely! Check out [our monorepo guide][guides.advanced.monorepository].

## Does Qovery support microservices?

Yes, absolutely! Check out [our microservices guide][guides.advanced.microservices].

## What Git providers do you support?

GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket.

## Do you support GitHub Enterprise or Gitlab Self-hosted?

Not at the moment, but you can upvote for this feature in [our roadmap][urls.qovery_roadmap].

## Does Qovery support private Git repository?

Yes, absolutely!

## Which IP address does my cluster use to communicate externally over the Internet?

There isn't just one public cluster IP adress dedicated to external communication. However, [worker nodes][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#what-is-a-cluster] inside your cluster each have a public IP automatically attached to them. You can view those default public IPs in the details of your worker nodes (EC2 instances for AWS users) which belong to the node group in your cluster.

For improved security and control, the `Static IP` feature allows you to ensure that outbound traffic from your cluster uses specific IP addresses. For more information on the `Static IP` feature and how to enable it at cluster creation, see [Static IP][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#static-ip].

## If I have N custom domains under the same root domain, do I need to create N CNAME records, or just creating one for the root domain is enough ?

You have to create N CNAME, one per custom domain

## How do you support new Kubernetes version?

The Qovery team manages your Kubernetes cluster's upgrade, and you don't have to think about it. Upgrades from one minor Kubernetes version to another require a good amount of tests to make sure everything goes smoothly with zero interruptions for your app. This is why Qovery always provides 1 or 2 minor versions below the last one offered by the cloud provider. Our goal is to guarantee you the maximum uptime.

## Can I upgrade my cluster myself

NO and you SHOULDN'T !

## Can I have access to my Kubernetes cluster?

Absolutely, you can follow [this guide][guides.tutorial.how-to-connect-to-your-eks-cluster-with-kubectl].

## Can I have access to my application with a shell?

Absolutely, check out our [CLI][docs.using-qovery.interface.cli#shell] and the `qovery shell` command.

## How application auto-scaling works?

Take a look at [our application documentation][docs.using-qovery.configuration.application#auto-scaling].
