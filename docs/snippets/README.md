## Note on Reusability

Mintlify supports importing snippets as MDX components (`import Foo from "/snippets/foo.mdx"; <Foo />`), and every credentials snippet listed above is now consumed this way. Therefore:
- Update the snippet file, and every page that imports it picks up the change automatically. No manual copying.
- This directory is the **single source of truth**: never hand-duplicate its content into a page.
- The `configuration/organization/cloud-credentials.mdx` usages listed above are inline (not yet converted to imports) — converting them is a good follow-up to fully retire manual copying for this content.
