<Assumptions name="documentation">

You have created an [Environment][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment].

</Assumptions>

A **cronjob** is a workload that runs on your kubernetes cluster on a regular bases depending on the configured schedule (See [Cronjob on Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/) for more info). It is useful to execute tasks on a regular bases, like pulling data from an external service every hour or process the last 24hrs of data in your database.

Qovery allows you to create and deploy cronjobs from two different sources: Git Repository or Container Registry

## Deploying from a Git Repository
In this configuration, Qovery will pull the code from the chosen repository, build the application and deploy it on your kubernetes cluster.

The list of Git repositories available during the setup is strictly tied to the permissions of your git account (by default Qovery can access all your repositories). You can also manage the access via dedicated [Git Tokens][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.git-repository-access].

## Deploying from a Container Registry
In this configuration, Qovery will pull the chosen image and deploy it on your kubernetes cluster.

To improve the security and avoid deploying images from non-authorized registries, we have decided to restrict the list of Container Registry you can use during the setup process. Only an administrator with the right permissions can manage it from the [Container Registry Management page][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.container-registry]


## Create a Cronjob

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>
<li>

Go into the chosen environment and press the "New Service" button and then the "Create Cronjob" button

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/environments/service_creation.png" alt="Creation" />
</p>

</li>
<li>

Select the following fields:
- Name: give a name to your applicaiton
- Source: Chose between Git Repository or Container Registry, depending on the source location of your application

If you want to deploy a cronjob from a Git Repository you will have to select:
- Git Repository: Select the git provider hosting your code (it can be hosted on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket). You can add a new git access by clicking on `New git access`.
- Branch: Select branch that Qovery should use to deploy your code
- Root Application Path: base folder in which the code resides in your repository
- Build and deploy: configure your Dockerfile location and parameters. For more information, go to [this section](#build-and-deploy)

<Alert type="info">

A Dockerfile is necessary to build and deploy your job

</Alert>

If you want to deploy a cronjob from a Container Registry you will have to select:
- Registry: select the container registry storing the image of your job. You can add a new container registry by clicking on `New registry`.
- Image name: the name of the image to be deployed with this job (example: postgres)
- Image tag: the tag of the image to be deployed with this job (example: 12)
- Deploy: configure your deployment parameters. For more information, go to [this section](#build-and-deploy)

<Alert type="info">

The tag 'latest' is not supported, please use a specific tag.

</Alert>

** Auto Deploy **

See the [Deploying with auto-deploy feature][docs.qovery.deployment.deploying-with-auto-deploy] section.

** Extra labels/annotations (optional)**

Add your extra annotation/label groups. See the [Add annotation/label group][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.labels-annotations] section for more information.

</li>
<li>
Specify the configuration of your job:

- CRON Schedule: specify a valid CRON expression (see [Crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/) for help). After being deployed, the job will be executed following the defined schedule.
- Timezone: select a valid timezone identifier. After being deployed, the job will be executed following the defined timezone. `Etc/UTC` is the default value.
- Image Entrypoint: the entrypoint to be used to launch your job (not mandatory)
- CMD Arguments: the arguments to be passed to launch your application (not mandatory) separated with a space. Example: `rails -h 0.0.0.0 -p 8080 string "complex arg"`.
- Number of restarts: Maximum number of restarts allowed in case of job failure (0 means no failure)
- Max duration time in seconds: Maximum duration allowed for the job to run before killing it and mark it as failed
- Port: Port used by Kubernetes to run readiness and liveliness probes checks. The port will not be exposed externally

</li>
<li>
Within this section, you will need to define the resources to be assigned to your job at run time.

- vCPU: the vCPU assigned to each instance of your application. The default is 500m (0.5 vCPU).
- RAM: the amount of RAM assigned to each instance of your application. The default is 512MB.

<Alert type="info">

Please note that in this section you configure the CPU/RAM allocated by the cluster for your application and that cannot consume more than this value. Even if the application is underused and consume less resources, the cluster will still reserve the selected amount of CPU/RAM.

</Alert>


</li>
<li>

Define any input variable required by your job to run. Any declared variable will be injected as environment variables based on the selected scope (project, environment, service)
Any additional environment variable can be added later from the environment variable section

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/job/variables.png" alt="Input Variables" />
</p>

</li>
<li>

You will find a recap of your job setup and you can now decide to:
1. Go back to one of the previous steps and change your settings
2. Create your job without deploying it
3. Create and deploy your job

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/job/cronjob_recap.png" alt="Recap" />
</p>

</li>
</ol>
</Steps>

## Deployment Management
Have a look at the [Deployment Management][docs.using-qovery.deployment] section for more information.

## Force Run

You can force the execution of a job independently its deployment status by:

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>
<li>

Select the job that you want to force

</li>
<li>

click on the `Play` button of the cronjob you want to force and select the `Force Run` option. Note: the same option is available on the service list as well


</li>
<li>

Once you click, the job will be deployed and executed once. You will be able to follow its execution within the application logs

</li>
</ol>
</Steps>

<Alert type="info">

If the cronjob has not yet been deployed, forcing its execution will make it run only once (the scheduling mechanism will not start).

</Alert>

## Configuration

Once created, you can access the configuration at any time via the Settings tab available on the service section

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/settings.png" alt="Settings" />
</p>

You can find below the description of each of the tabs available in this section

### General

General settings section allows you to set up your application name and the source code location (git repository or image registry) .

#### Git Repository
If your job is built and deployed from a git repository, within this section you can:
- Modify the git provider where your code is stored (it can be hosted on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket).
- Modify the branch that Qovery should use for deploying your code
- Modify `Root Application Path` - base folder in which the application resides in your repository

<Alert type="info">

Qovery supports mono repositories. [See our advanced guide for more details.][guides.advanced.monorepository]

</Alert>

<Alert type="warning">

If your repository contains private submodules using SSH protocol, you will need to add a secret beginning with GIT_SSH_KEY_, containing a private SSH key with access rights to your sumbodules repositories.

Secret names examples:

- GIT_SSH_KEY_GITHUB
- GIT_SSH_KEY_GITLAB
- GIT_SSH_KEY_MYAPP

</Alert>

#### Container Registry
If your application is deployed from an image registry, within this section you can modify:
- Registry: select the container registry storing the image of your application. Note: only pre-configured registry are available in this list, check the [Container Registry Management page][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.container-registry] for more information.
- Image name: the name of the image to be deployed with this application (example: postgres)
- Image tag: the tag of the image to be deployed with this application (example: 12)

<Alert type="info">

The tag 'latest' is not supported, please use a specific tag.

</Alert>

#### Build and Deploy

Within this section, you can configure the following fields:
- Dockerfile: select the location of the dockerfile. If you don't have one, you can use the `docker init` command to generate one for your application (check the [documentation here](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/init/)). After creating a Dockerfile, specify the location of your Dockerfile in `Dockefile path` field. (field available only if the application built by the Qovery CI)
- Dockerfile stage: if you have a multistage dockerfile, select the target stage to build. Filling this field is equivalent to running the command `docker build --target <selected_stage>`  (field available only if the application built by the Qovery CI)
- Image Entrypoint: the entrypoint to be used to launch your application (not mandatory)
- CMD Arguments: the arguments to be passed to launch your application (not mandatory) separated with a space. Example: `rails -h 0.0.0.0 -p 8080 string "complex arg"`.

** Auto Deploy **

See the [Deploying with auto-deploy feature][docs.qovery.deployment.deploying-with-auto-deploy] section.

#### Extra labels/annotations

Add your extra annotation/label groups. See the [Add annotation/label group][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.labels-annotations] section for more information.

### JOB Configuration
You can modify here the configuration of your job:
- CRON Schedule: specify a valid CRON expression (see [Crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/) for help). After being deployed, the job will be executed following the defined schedule.
- Timezone: select a valid timezone identifier. After being deployed, the job will be executed following the defined timezone. `Etc/UTC` is the default value.
- Image Entrypoint: the entrypoint to be used to launch your job (not mandatory)
- CMD Arguments: the arguments to be passed to launch your application (not mandatory) separated with a space. Example: `rails -h 0.0.0.0 -p 8080 string "complex arg"`.

- Max duration time in seconds: Maximum duration allowed for the job to run before killing it and mark it as failed
- Port: Port used by Kubernetes to run readiness and liveliness probes checks. The port will not be exposed externally

### Resources

#### CPU

To configure the number of CPUs that your job needs, adjust the setting in the `Resources` section.

<Alert type="info">

Default is 500m (0.5 vCPU). 

</Alert>

Please note that in this section you configure the CPU allocated by the cluster for your application and that cannot consume more than this value. Even if the application is underused and consume less resources, the cluster will still reserve the selected amount of CPU.

#### RAM

To configure the amount of RAM that your app needs, adjust the setting in `Resources` section.

<Alert type="info">

Default is 512MB.

</Alert>

Please note that in this section you configure the CPU allocated by the cluster for your application and that cannot consume more than this value. Even if the application is underused and consume less resources, the cluster will still reserve the selected amount of CPU. If your application requires more RAM than requested, it will be killed by the kubernetes scheduler.

### Health Checks
