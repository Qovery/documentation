Managed RDS instances deployed with Qovery have by default a backup option enabled on the same region where the RDS instance is located.

If for compliance reasons you have to manage a multi-region backup for your database, this guide will help you to configure an AWS Backup job to achieve this setup. For more information about AWS Backup, have a look at [this documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html).

# How to configure

<!--
     THIS FILE IS AUTOGENERATED!

     To make changes please edit the template located at:

     website/guides/advanced/adding-multi-region-backup-rds.md.erb
-->

## 1. Create an AWS Backup Plan

Go to the AWS Console and follow [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/creating-a-backup-plan.html#create-backup-plan-console) to create your AWS Backup plan. For the setup, you can use the default settings but take into account the following points:
- **Vault**: you can use the default vault as long as you don't have any additional security requirement (share snapshots externally etc.)
- **Start time**: update the start time based on your needs
- **Total retention period**: update the retention period for the snapshots based on your needs
- **Copy to destination**: at this step, select the region where you want to create the database snapshot

Press **Create Plan**

## 2. Assign resources

On the next step, we will define the resource that this backup job should target:

1. Select the option "Include specific resource types"
2. In the dropdown list for "Select specific resource types", select "RDS"
3. (Optional) if you don't want this plan to run on every RDS instance, uncheck the option "All databases" and select the databases from the dropdown list
4. Press "Assign Resources"

# Checking the new backups

Now, based on your schedule, you should see backup jobs starting and creating backups in the selected vault:

1. Select the region where the backup should be created
2. Open the "Vault" section on the right
3. Select the vault that the AWS backup job should target
4. Verify that new "Recovery points" have been created
