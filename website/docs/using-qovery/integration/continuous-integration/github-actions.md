Using GitHub Actions with Qovery is super powerful and gives you the ability to manage the way that you want to deploy your applications. As the possibility are endless, I will share with you a couple of examples that you can use. Feel free to adapt them to your need.

## Prerequisites

Before using the examples below, you need to:

1. Install the [Qovery CLI][docs.using-qovery.interface.cli].
2. Generate an API token via [the CLI][docs.using-qovery.interface.cli#generate-api-token] or the [Console][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.api-token] .
3. Set the environment variable `Q_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN` (both are valid) with your API token. E.g. `export QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-api-token`
4. You have turned off the [Qovery Auto Deployment][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment#auto-deploy] for your environment that you want to deploy manually.

## GitHub Actions Examples

<Alert type="success">

Qovery is compatible with GitHub Actions and GitHub Actions Enterprise.

### Deploy a container application

<Assumptions>

* You have [connected your Container Registry with Qovery][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.container-registry].
* You have a container application that you want to deploy on Qovery.
* You have set the `QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable in your GitHub Actions project.

</Assumptions>

This example will deploy a container application with Qovery from your GitHub CI pipeline. Feel free to adapt it to your need.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/deploy-with-qovery.yml"

# 2. Deploy with Qovery

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repo

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub

        env:
          QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
        shell: bash
        run: |
          # Download and install Qovery CLI
          curl -s https://get.qovery.com | bash

          qovery container deploy \
            --organization <your_org_name> \
            --project <your_project_name> \
            --environment <your_environment_name> \
            --container <your_qovery_container_name> \
            --tag ${{ github.sha }} \
            --watch
```

## Qovery CLI command examples

### Deploy your application with a specific commit ID

```bash
qovery application deploy \
  --organization <your_org_name> \
  --project <your_project_name> \
  --environment <your_environment_name> \
  --application <your_app_name> \
  --commit-id <your_commit_id> \
  --watch
```

<Alert type="success">

`--watch` is an optional parameter that will display the status of the deployment and return 0 if the deployment is successful or 1 if it fails.

</Alert>

### Deploy your multiple applications with a different commit ID

```bash
# deploy the application 1 and wait for the deployment to be successful with the --watch argument
qovery application deploy \
  --organization <your_org_name> \
  --project <your_project_name> \
  --environment <your_environment_name> \
  --application <your_app_1_name> \
  --commit-id <your_commit_id> \
  --watch

# deploy the application 2 and wait for the deployment to be successful with the --watch argument
qovery application deploy \
  --organization <your_org_name> \
  --project <your_project_name> \
  --environment <your_environment_name> \
  --application <your_app_2_name> \
  --commit-id <your_commit_id> \
  --watch
```
This is also applicable for the `qovery container deploy`, `qovery lifecycle deploy`, and `qovery cronjob deploy` commands.

### Deploy your multiple applications with a specific commit ID (monorepo)

```bash
# deploy the application 1, 2 and 3 with the same commit ID and wait for the deployment to be successful with the --watch argument
qovery application deploy \
  --organization <your_org_name> \
  --project <your_project_name> \
  --environment <your_environment_name> \
  --applications "<app_1_name>, <app_2_name>, <app_3_name>" \
  --commit-id <your_commit_id> \
  --watch
```

This is also applicable for the `qovery container deploy`, `qovery lifecycle deploy`, and `qovery cronjob deploy` commands.

### Create a Preview Environment for your Pull-Request

Qovery integrates automatically with GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket to create a Preview Environment for each Pull-Request. But in case you want to control the creation of the Preview Environment manually, you can use the following commands:

```shell
# Clone your base environment
qovery environment clone \
  --organization <your_org_name> \
  --project <your_project_name> \
  --environment <your_environment_name> \
  --new-environment-name <your_new_environment_name>

# Change your application branch to the Pull-Request branch
qovery application update \
  --organization <your_org_name> \
  --project <your_project_name> \
  --environment <your_new_environment_name> \
  --application <your_app_name> \
  --branch <your_pull_request_branch_name>

# Deploy your new environment
qovery environment deploy \
  --organization <your_org_name> \
  --project <your_project_name> \
  --environment <your_new_environment_name> \
  --watch
```

### Delete a Preview Environment

```shell
qovery environment delete \
  --organization <your_org_name> \
  --project <your_project_name> \
  --environment <your_preview_environment_name> \
  --watch
```

### Terraform
