Once observability is enabled, go to the **Monitoring** tab at the service level in the Qovery console.  
This tab gives you real-time and historical visibility into your applications.

## Service Health

The **Service Health Check** provides an overview of running instances and recent events:
- **Qovery events** (e.g. deployments, failed deployments) and Kubernetes events** (e.g. autoscaler triggered, OOMKilled pod, health check failures).

- **Log errors counter** – automatically counts error-level logs. You can jump directly into logs at the exact point where errors occurred.  
- **HTTP error rate (499 and 5xx errors)** – aggregated over all requests, with the ability to expand and view the breakdown by **endpoint** and **status code**.  
- **Network request duration (P99)** – shows tail latency of your requests, expandable to include P90 and P50.  

## Resources

Resource usage is tracked per pod:  

- **CPU usage** – compared against your request and limit.  
- **Memory usage** – compared against your request and limit.

## Network

Qovery provides network-level observability:  

- **Request status** by path and error code.  
- **Request duration** with percentiles (P50, P95, P99).  
- **Request size** statistics.

If your application exposes a **public port**, metrics reflect ingress traffic.  
If no public port is exposed, metrics reflect **internal traffic** within the cluster.  

## Controls

- **Live update**: toggle continuous refresh of charts.  
- **Custom time frame**: select the time range of data to display.
