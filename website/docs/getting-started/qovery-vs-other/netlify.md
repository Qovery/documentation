### When to choose Netlify
* You want to deploy a simple web app.
* You don't need to host a backend app with a database.
* You want to use a turn-key hosting platform.

### When to choose Qovery
* You need to deploy a backend app with one or more databases.
* You need to host microservices and complex apps.
* You want to use your AWS account.

## Qovery vs. Netlify: a detailed comparison
### Qovery runs on your AWS account
Qovery runs on your AWS account, and this is a big difference with Netlify. The goal of Qovery is to simplify the access to the Cloud for any developer and company. Plug your AWS account into Qovery, and then you are ready to deploy your apps in just a few seconds! Qovery is installable on your AWS account in 20 minutes.

This is the opposite on Netlify. You can't use your Cloud provider account to host your apps and data. You must use the hosting provided by Netlify.

* [Get started with Qovery on your AWS account][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider.amazon-web-services]
* [See other supported Cloud providers][docs.using-qovery.configuration.cloud-service-provider]

### Predictable cost

Please don't take our word for it; see some cost comparisons below.

| Cost for...                | Qovery                                             | Netlify                                                               |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10 apps with 1GB of RAM    | $0                                                 | $500/month                                                            |
| Additional user            | $40 per user/month                                 | From $19 to $99 per user/month                                        |

Qovery does not include your Cloud cost

### Cloud cost optimization
Qovery and Netlify have the same spirit concerning Cloud cost optimization. But with Qovery, you can go a step further in Cloud cost optimization by:

* Automatically turning off unused resources.
* Autoscale up and down your apps according to real usage.
* Reduce the number of dependencies - which leads to lower costs and problems.

### Qovery lets you use your AWS credits
As Qovery runs on your AWS account, you are free to use your credits. We also want to support you and give you free access to Qovery ([contact us][urls.qovery_contact_us]), then you can start as soon as possible to focus on your business without having to pay a penny.

Netlify does not provide free credits to companies.

### Infrastructure and DevOps control

* Netlify's infrastructure is hidden for good and bad reasons. The problem is that you have no control over it. Qovery relies on the managed services provided by the Cloud provider. You have full control of the type of resources you want to allocate and put your hands on if required. Qovery is transparent, where Netlify is a black box.

* Netlify focuses on the developer needs only, Qovery focuses on the developer needs and provides full control to a DevOps team via a plugin system. To go further than that, Qovery generates Terraform and Helm files (familiar to DevOps) to deploy the infrastructure and the developers' apps. If the DevOps is not satisfied by the default configuration of Qovery, they can change it.

### Qovery is built for privacy
Qovery does not host your apps and your data. Your data are stored on your AWS account. Even your app logs are stored on your AWS account and encrypted. Privacy is the present, and the future; that's why Qovery is privacy proof by design.

[read more][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment]

### No vendor lock-in
1. Our [deployment engine][urls.qovery_engine] is open-source.
2. Reversibility: Your apps run on your AWS account. If you are not satisfied with our product, we give you access to all generated configuration files (Terraform, Helm, and others) and keep running your infrastructure.

Where Netlify is a black box. They do everything they can to lock you and keep you forever.
