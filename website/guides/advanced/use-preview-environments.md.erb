Use Preview Environment to get early feedback on your application changes by creating a dedicated environment for each of your pull requests.
Your production environment runs 24/7, where your other environments may not need to run all day long.
E.g. you may need to run Environments to get early feedback on your application changes before the changes are merged into production. This is what we call **Preview Environment**.

>  Sometimes **Preview Environment** is also known as **Ephemeral Environment**, **Temporary Environment**, **Development Environment**, **Review App**.

## Recommendations

If you are using Qovery to run your Production, we recommend using Preview Environments on a separate [cluster][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters]. This will ensure that your Production is not impacted by the Preview Environments and vice versa.

## Resources

Here are some resources you can use to use and take advantage of Qovery Preview Environments:
