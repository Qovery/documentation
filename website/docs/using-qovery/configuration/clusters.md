### Performing Actions on your Clusters

Qovery allows you to [update][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#updating-a-cluster], [stop][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#stopping-a-cluster], [restart][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#restarting-a-cluster] or [delete][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#deleting-a-cluster] your clusters at organization level.

| Action                | Description    | Cloud provider    |
|---------------------------------|---------|---------|
|[Updating a cluster][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#updating-a-cluster]| To redeploy your cluster after a change has been made to it.| ![AWS Icon](/img/advanced_settings/aws.svg) ![GCP Icon](/img/advanced_settings/gcp.svg) ![SCW Icon](/img/advanced_settings/scaleway.svg) |
|[Stopping a cluster][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#stopping-a-cluster]| To temporarily stop your cluster. Some services you have subscribed to via your cloud provider may still be active and incur costs when your cluster is stopped. For more information, see [Stopping a cluster][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#stopping-a-cluster].| ![AWS Icon](/img/advanced_settings/aws.svg) |
|[Restarting a cluster][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#restarting-a-cluster]| To restart your cluster after it has been temporarily stopped.| ![AWS Icon](/img/advanced_settings/aws.svg) ![GCP Icon](/img/advanced_settings/gcp.svg) ![SCW Icon](/img/advanced_settings/scaleway.svg) |
|[Deleting a cluster][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#deleting-a-cluster]| To delete your cluster. This is final and needs to be done properly to ensure all the services deployed by Qovery on your cloud provider's account are disabled, with no leftover cloud-related costs. For more information, see [Deleting a cluster][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#deleting-a-cluster].| ![AWS Icon](/img/advanced_settings/aws.svg) ![GCP Icon](/img/advanced_settings/gcp.svg) ![SCW Icon](/img/advanced_settings/scaleway.svg) |

To access these actions:

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>
<li>

Open your [Qovery Console][urls.qovery_console].

</li>
<li>

On the left menu bar, click on the Cluster page.

</li>
<li>

To view your cluster actions, click `Play` button:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/clusters/cluster_actions.png" alt="Cluster Actions Menu" />
</p>

A dropdown menu unfolds, featuring all the actions available on your cluster.

</li>

</ol>
</Steps>

You can follow the execution of the action via the cluster status and/or by accessing the [Cluster Logs][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#logs]

#### Updating a Cluster

If you made a change on your cluster, you need to run an update on your cluster to propagate remotely the new configuration.

To update your cluster, select the action `Update` from the drop-down menu.

A confirmation pop-up window opens before triggering the action.

Once confirmed, the status of your cluster turns `Updating...` (orange status).

Once the update is complete, the status dot next to your cluster turns green.

#### Stopping a Cluster

Qovery allows you to temporarily stop your cluster instead of deleting it.

<Alert type="warning">

When you stop a cluster from the Qovery console, only the workers nodes managed by Qovery are stopped. If you have subscribed to services via your cloud provider (load balancing, storage system, or any other managed services), they will remain active and you will be charged for them.
For more information, please contact your cloud provider.
To permanently delete a cluster and all its associated costs, see [Deleting a Cluster][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#deleting-a-cluster].

</Alert>

To temporarily stop a cluster, select the `Stop` action from the drop-down menu.
A confirmation pop-up window opens before triggering the action.

Once confirmed, the status of your cluster turns to `Pausing...` (orange status).

Once the stop is complete, the status dot next to your cluster turns to grey, and the status of your cluster turns to `Paused` (gray status).

#### Restarting a Cluster

You can restart a cluster after it has been temporarily stopped.

To restart your cluster, select the action `Resume` from the drop-down menu.

A confirmation pop-up window opens before triggering the action.

Once confirmed, the status of your cluster turns to `Updating...` (orange status).

Once your cluster has restarted, the status dot next to your cluster turns to green.


#### Deleting a Cluster

<Alert type="warning">

Deleting a cluster from the Qovery console is final and cannot be reverted.

To only temporarily stop a cluster, see [Stopping a Cluster][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#stopping-a-cluster].

</Alert>

To delete a cluster, open the `...` section and press `Delete Cluster`.

<Alert type="info">

If you encounter any issue during the deletion process, please refer to the [Troubleshooting section][docs.using-qovery.troubleshoot.cluster-troubleshoot].

</Alert>

3 options can be chosen to delete a cluster:

** 1) Default **
This is the default behaviour, this option shall be chosen every time you want to delete properly a cluster from the Qovery console AND your cloud provider account.

This operation will delete:

- **Cloud provider**: any resource created by Qovery on your cloud provider account to run this cluster will be deleted, including any application running on it.
- **Qovery organization**: the configuration of this cluster and any linked environment.

<Alert type="warning">

Please note that you will have to manually delete on your cloud account:
- the S3 bucket created at cluster installation
- the image registry linked to this cluster
- any resource created by a lifecycle job that will not be properly deleted during the `environment deletion` event.

Check [this section](#cleaning-up-a-cluster-from-your-aws-account) to find these elements and delete them.

</Alert>


** 2) Delete Cluster on cloud provider and Qovery configuration **

This option shall be chosen when the cluster delete operation with the `Default` option fails since you have manually modified/deleted the RDS instances created by Qovery on your cloud provider account.

This operation will delete:

- **Cloud provider**: any resource created by Qovery on your cloud provider account to run this cluster will be deleted, including any application running on it.
- **Qovery organization**: the configuration of this cluster and any linked environment.

<Alert type="warning">

Please note that you will have to manually delete on your cloud account:
- the S3 bucket created at cluster installation
- the image registry linked to this cluster
- any managed database that was created via Qovery
- any resource created by a lifecycle job that will not be properly deleted during the `environment deletion` event.

Check [this section](#cleaning-up-a-cluster-from-your-aws-account) to find these elements and delete them.

</Alert>

** 3) Delete Qovery config only **

This option shall be chosen when you have already deleted any Qovery resource on your cloud account and you want to delete the cluster object from your Qovery console.

This operation will delete:

- **Cloud provider**: nothing will be removed from your cloud account. You will have to manually delete any resource created by Qovery directly from your cloud provider console.
- **Qovery organization**: the configuration of this cluster and any linked environment.

<Alert type="info">

Check [this section](#cleaning-up-a-cluster-from-your-aws-account) to find these elements and delete them.

</Alert>

Once confirmed, the cluster status turns to `Deleting...` (red status) and once the deletion is complete, the cluster is removed from your organization settings.

#### Audit logs

To get the cluster filtered audit logs, open the `...` section and press `See audit logs`.

You will be redirected to the audit logs section. A filter on the dedicated cluster will be applied. You only see the audit logs regarding cluster operations.

#### Get your cluster id

To get your Qovery cluster id, open the `...` section and press `Copy identifier`.

The cluster id in Qovery will be in your clipboard.

#### Get your cluster kubeconfig file

If you need to get your kubeconfig file, open the `...` section and press `Get Kubeconfig`.

Then the kubeconfig yaml file will be automatically downloaded.

## Logs

Qovery allows you to access the logs of your cluster in order to follow its installation or investigate any issue happening on it.

To access the logs you need to open the cluster, click the log button

<p align="center">
<img src="/img/configuration/clusters/cluster_logs_access.png" alt="Cluster Logs" />
</p>

A new window is opened, displaying the logs of the cluster.

<p align="center">
<img src="/img/configuration/clusters/ok-infra-logs.jpg" alt="Cluster Logs" />
</p>

The tab system on the right allows you to access the cluster information and, if an error occurs, the detail of the error.

<p align="center">
<img src="/img/configuration/clusters/error-infra-logs.jpg" alt="Cluster Logs" />
</p>

<Alert type="info">

The error message should provide you enough information to solve the issue. If that's not the case, feel free to ask for support on our [forum](https://discuss.qovery.com/)

</Alert>

## Use custom domain and wildcard TLS for the whole cluster (beta)

By default, Qovery provides a domain (ex `bool.sh`) on every deployed cluster. It is used to provide a DNS and TLS certificate to every application requiring external access on a cluster.

You can customize the domain for every application. However, when it comes to having more than 100 custom domains with the same domain you will hit [Let's Encrypt quotas](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/).

To overcome this issue, you can use a wildcard TLS certificate for the whole cluster. It will allow you to have as many DNS records for a single domain as you want on the same cluster with a single TLS certificate.

At the moment, Qovery only supports wildcard TLS certificates with [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). To use it, you need to have a Cloudflare account and a domain name managed by Cloudflare. If you don't have one, you can create a free account and transfer your domain to Cloudflare.

Once you have a Cloudflare account and a domain name managed by Cloudflare, you need to create a Cloudflare API token. Go into your Cloudflare account, click on your profile picture, then `My Profile`. In the `API Tokens` section, click on `Create Token`. In the `Create Custom Token` section, select the following permissions:

* API token a descriptive name: Qovery domain `your domain name`
* Permissions:
  * Zone - DNS - Edit
  * Zone - Zone - Read
* Zone Resources:
  * Include - Specific zone - `your domain name`

To finish, click on `Continue to Summary` and `Create Token`. Save the token somewhere safe, you will need it later.

Prepare the Token, the Cloudflare account email and the domain to be set on your cluster. Now contact Qovery and request to use your domain.

## Cleaning up a Cluster from your AWS Account

<Alert type="warning">

The following troubleshooting procedure is intended for AWS users who did not properly delete their cluster before revoking Qovery's access to their platform.

To properly delete your clusters and avoid any unexpected issues or costs, see [Deleting a Cluster][docs.using-qovery.configuration.clusters#deleting-a-cluster].

</Alert>

To clean up a Qovery cluster from your cloud provider account, go to `AWS Console`>`Services`>`Management & Governance`>`Resource Groups & Tag Editor`> `Create Resource Group`:

| 4    | Click `Preview Resources`. <br /> All your Qovery clusters are now displayed in the `Group resources` table, and you can delete them by hand.|

## FAQ

### What is a cluster?

Please refer to the [basic concepts section][docs.getting-started.basic-concepts#cluster]

### Why do I need a cluster?

Qovery is built on top of Kubernetes, which means we need Kubernetes clusters to be able to deploy and run your applications.

Thanks to clusters, you can easily deploy several (and many) instances of the same application, so that if one fails, the others can instantly take over. Also, clusters can auto-scale, meaning that the number of worker nodes in a cluster can automatically go up or down as traffic fluctuates on your application(s), thus ensuring high availability and performance. Clusters are also extremely useful [to isolate your production environment from your staging environment](https://www.qovery.com/blog/how-to-isolate-your-production-from-staging-with-kubernetes).

In short, through the use of clusters, Kubernetes provides you with a resilient, flexible and powerful infrastructure, fit for production environment needs and requirements. And with the help of Qovery, setting up and maintaining your Kubernetes clusters has never been easier.


### What are the different instance types available when creating a cluster?

The range of instance types available at cluster creation depends on your cloud provider:

* AWS offers over 400 instance types. You can [view their details on the official AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/), as well as [their pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/).
* Scaleway also offers a wide range of instance types, [whose details and pricing you can view on the official Scaleway website](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/).
* GCP clusters are deployed in auto-pilot mode so you will have access by default to every instance type available 

<Alert type="info">

Qovery supports only instance types having an x86_64 or ARM architecture.

</Alert>

### How does Qovery handle Kubernetes version upgrades?

As far as cluster upgrades to a newer version of Kubernetes are concerned, our Qovery engineering team handles everything in due time, so you don’t even need to think about it!

<Alert type="info">

You may notice that Qovery does not provide you with the latest Kubernetes version offered by your cloud provider. This is due to the high amount of testing we need to perform to ensure smooth upgrades with no interruptions for your applications. Our priority is always to guarantee you maximum uptime.

</Alert>

<Alert type="warning">

Please **DO NOT** upgrade the cluster version by yourself from the cloud provider console.

**Proceeding with a cluster version upgrade outside of Qovery will prevent any future update on this cluster** and might be irreversible preventing Qovery from properly deploying on this cluster. Most importantly will expose you to some unknown / untested areas which can put your application stability at risks.

If you did update by mistake, then you need to reach to Qovery team in order to get some help.

</Alert>

Usually, we work on a given upgrade for one month of intensive testing on our end in order to make sure everything will be smooth for you. Once we are pretty confident our stack is stable, we move on with the following steps which last approximately 3 weeks:

1. Notify users about new version coming in approximatively 1 month before
2. Upgrade clusters for a handful of beta-tester customers (1 week)
3. Make available the new version for all clusters (new or existing)
4. Upgrade all non-production flagged clusters (1 week)
5. Upgrade all clusters the production clusters (1 week)

If, somehow the planning or timeframe for the upgrade is clashing with your business needs, you will be able to trigger the upgrade of your cluster manually via the "Upgrade to XX.XX" action available from the `Play` menu of your cluster. This action will be available on your cluster once we will make the new version available globally (step 3), you will notice that the `Play` button of your cluster will be highlighted in yellow.


### What do you do when a vulnerability is found?

Security is our main concern. When a vulnerability is found, here are the actions that we take:

1. We quickly identify how significant is the impact of the vulnerability.
2. We look at how we can solve or mitigate the vulnerability.
3. We transparently communicate with our customers about the vulnerability to help them take the right actions.


### What is a mirroring registry?

It's the registry used by Qovery to push the image built by the Qovery CI or mirror the images that you want to deploy from your own registry. Check [this documentation][docs.using-qovery.deployment.image-mirroring] for more information

### Why is my status showing as unavailable?

When accessing the Clusters view from the Qovery Console, you may sometimes encounter the status Unavailable for one of your clusters.

<p align="center"> <img src="/img/configuration/clusters/cluster_status_unavailable.png" alt="Cluster Unavailable Status" /> </p>
This Unavailable status indicates that Qovery was not able to retrieve the current status of your cluster. This situation can occur in the following cases:

The cluster has been manually stopped or is not running.

There is a technical issue preventing Qovery from communicating with your cluster (for example: missing credentials, misconfiguration, or network problems).

If you see this status and are unsure why it appears:

<Alert type="warning">
We recommend that you double-check the status of your cluster directly in your cloud provider console.

</Alert>
If everything seems fine on your side or you need help understanding the issue, feel free to reach out to our support team.
