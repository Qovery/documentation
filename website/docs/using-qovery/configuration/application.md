<Assumptions name="documentation">

You have created an [Environment][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment].

</Assumptions>

An **application** is part of a [Project][docs.using-qovery.configuration.project] within an [Environment][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment] and is a container unit. Multiple applications can be part of the same [Environment][docs.using-qovery.configuration.environment], be connected to a set of dependencies (databases and other services), and can communicate with other applications within the same Environment.

Qovery allows you to create and deploy applications from two different sources: Git Repository or Container Registry

<!--
     THIS FILE IS AUTOGENERATED!

     To make changes please edit the template located at:

     website/docs/using-qovery/configuration/application.md.erb
-->

## Deploying from a Git Repository
In this configuration, Qovery will pull the code from the chosen repository, build the application and deploy it on your kubernetes cluster.

The list of Git repositories available during the setup is strictly tied to the permissions of your git account (by default Qovery can access all your repositories). If you want to restrict the Qovery access only to a few repositories, user the [GitHub Qovery Application][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.git-repository-access] (only for Github).

## Deploying from a Container Registry
In this configuration, Qovery will pull the chosen container registry an image you have pre-built and deploy it on your kubernetes cluster.

To improve security and avoid deploying images from non-authorized registries, we have decided to restrict the list of Container Registry you can use during the setup process. Only an administrator with the right permissions can manage it from the [Container Registry Management page][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.container-registry]

<Alert type="info">

Make sure that the image tag used are unique (do not use "latest", "dev", "master" etc..), see [this section][docs.using-qovery.deployment.image-mirroring#why-unique-image-tags-are-necessary] for more information.

</Alert>

## Create an Application

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>
<li>

Go into the chosen environment and press the "New Service" button and then the "Create application" button

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/creation_1.png" alt="Creation" />
</p>

</li>
<li>

Select the following fields:
- Application Name: give a name to your application
- Application Source: Chose between Git Repository or Container Registry, depending on the source location of your application

If you want to deploy an application from a Git Repository you will have to select:
- Git Repository: Select the git provider hosting your code (it can be hosted on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket). You can add a new git access by clicking on `New git access`.
- Branch: Select branch that Qovery should use to deploy your application
- Root Application Path: base folder in which the application resides in your repository
- Build Mode: choose between Docker or Buildpack. For more information, go to [this section][docs.using-qovery.configuration.application#build-mode]

If you want to deploy an application from a Container Registry you will have to select:
- Registry: select the container registry storing the image of your application. You can add a new container registry by clicking on `New registry`.
- Image name: the name of the image to be deployed with this application (example: postgres)
- Image tag: the tag of the image to be deployed with this application (example: 1.0). 
- Image Entrypoint: the entrypoint to be used to launch your application (not mandatory)
- CMD Arguments: the arguments to be passed to launch your application (not mandatory) separated with a space. Example: `rails -h 0.0.0.0 -p 8080 string "complex arg"`.

<Alert type="info">

Make sure that the image tag used are unique (do not use "latest", "dev", "master" etc..), see [this section][docs.using-qovery.deployment.image-mirroring#why-unique-image-tags-are-necessary] for more information.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

If the base image in your Dockerfile is from a private registry, you just have to add the access to this registry before creating your application. See [Container Registry Management page][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.container-registry] for more information.

</Alert>

** Auto Deploy **

See the [Deploying with auto-deploy feature][docs.qovery.deployment.deploying-with-auto-deploy] section.

** Extra labels/annotations (optional)**

Add your extra annotation/label groups. See the [Add annotation/label group][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.labels-annotations] section for more information.

</li>
<li>

Within this section, you will need to define the resources to be assigned to your application at run time.

- vCPU: the vCPU assigned to each instance of your application. The default is 500m (0.5 vCPU).
- RAM: the amount of RAM assigned to each instance of your application. The default is 512MB.
- Number of instances (Application Auto-scaling): select the minimum and the maximum number of instances of your application that can run within your cluster. The number of instances running at an insant t is automatically managed by Kubernetes (Application auto-scaling) and it is based on real-time CPU consumption. When your app goes above 60% of CPU consumption for 5 minutes, your app will be auto-scaled and more instances will be added. It is transparent.
 Qovery runs your application on Kubernetes and relies on [metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) service to auto-scale your app.

<Alert type="info">

Please note that in this section you configure the CPU/RAM allocated by the cluster for your application and that cannot consume more than this value. Even if the application is underused and consume less resources, the cluster will still reserve the selected amount of CPU/RAM.

</Alert>


<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/application_creation_resources.png" alt="Resources" />
</p>

</li>
<li>

You can now define one or more ports for your Application. Most of the application needs to be accessed by other services inside or outside your environment over different L7/L4 protocols.
Today Qovery supports the following protocols:
- HTTPS (Select this protocol if you need to run Websockets)
- gRPC
- TCP
- UDP

By default ports are accessible only from inside your environment. You can also expose them publicly, making them accessible over the public network via a dedicated public domain that will be assigned to your application by Qovery during the deployment (See the [Qovery Provided Domains section](#qovery-provided-domains)). Note that HTTPS/gRPC ports are always exposed over the port 443.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/application_creation_port.png" alt="Application Ports" />
</p>


**Important Informations**

- Most of the [Kubernetes Health Checks][docs.using-qovery.configuration.service-health-checks] are based on the port declared in this section. Make sure you declare the right port and that you configure the health checks properly.
- Connections on public ports are automatically closed after 60 seconds. If you want to implement long living connection (like for websockets) please make sure to use the rigth ingress timeouts in the [advanced settings section][docs.using-qovery.configuration.advanced-settings#network-settings]
- Exposing publicly TCP/UDP ports requires to create a dedicated load balancer and it takes a few minutes before having it ready (~15 minutes). Note also that this has a direct impact on your cloud provider bill.
- You can configure your application to use the **PORT** environment variable by adding the **PORT** on your application env variables page.
- A Note on Listening IPs: It is best for your application to listen on `0.0.0.0:$PORT`. While most things work with `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`, some do not (NodeJS for example)

</li>

<li>

(Optional) If a port has been defined for your application, you can define the health check probes to run in order to verify the state of your application

To know more about how to configure your Liveness and Readiness probes, have a look at [the health-checks section][docs.using-qovery.configuration.application-health-checks]

</li>

<li>

You will find a recap of your application setup and you can now decide to:
- Go back to one of the previous steps and change your application settings
- Create your application without deploying it
- Create and deploy your application

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/application_creation_recap.png" alt="Application" />
</p>

</li>
</ol>
</Steps>

## Deployment Management
Have a look at the [Deployment Management][docs.using-qovery.deployment] section for more information.

## Configuration

Once created, you can access the configuration of an application at any time via the Settings tab available on the application section

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/settings.png" alt="Application Settings" />
</p>

You can find below the description of each of the tabs available in this section

### General

General settings section allows you to set up your application name and the source code location (git repository or image registry) .

#### Git Repository
If your application is built and deployed from a git repository, within this section you can:
- Modify the git provider where your code is stored (it can be hosted on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket).
- Modify the branch that Qovery should use for deploying your application
- Modify `Root Application Path` - base folder in which the application resides in your repository

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/app-general-git.png" alt="General Settings Git" />
</p>

<Alert type="info">

Qovery supports mono repositories. [See our advanced guide for more details.][guides.advanced.monorepository]

</Alert>

<Alert type="warning">

If your repository contains private submodules using SSH protocol, you will need to add a secret beginning with GIT_SSH_KEY_, containing a private SSH key with access rights to your sumbodules repositories.

Secret names examples:

- GIT_SSH_KEY_GITHUB
- GIT_SSH_KEY_GITLAB
- GIT_SSH_KEY_MYAPP

</Alert>

#### Container Registry
If your application is deployed from an image registry, within this section you can modify:
- Registry: select the container registry storing the image of your application. Note: only pre-configured registry are available in this list, check the [Container Registry Management page][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.container-registry] for more information.
- Image name: the name of the image to be deployed with this application (example: postgres)
- Image tag: the tag of the image to be deployed with this application (example: 1.0).
- Image Entrypoint: the entrypoint to be used to launch your applicaiton (not mandatory)
- CMD Arguments: the arguments to be passed to launch your applicaiton (not mandatory). We expect the format to be an array. Example ["rails", "-h", "0.0.0.0", "-p", "8080", "string"]

<Alert type="info">

Make sure that the image tag used are unique (do not use "latest", "dev", "master" etc..), see [this section][docs.using-qovery.deployment.image-mirroring#why-unique-image-tags-are-necessary] for more information.

</Alert>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/app-general-registry.png" alt="General Settings Git" />
</p>

#### Build Mode
This option is available only if you have selected "Git Repository" as source
#### Option 1: Buildpacks

To simplify the application build for the developer, Qovery supports [Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io) out of the box. Buildpacks determine the build process for an app and which assets and runtimes should be made available to your code at runtime. If your complex apps are running multiple languages, you can also use multiple buildpacks within a single app.
Meaning, as a developer, you don't need to write a `Dockerfile` to build and run your app. Qovery Buildpacks takes care of everything for you.

**Supported languages**

| language   | version |
|------------|---------|
| Node.JS    | any     |
| Clojure    | any     |
| Python     | any     |
| Java       | any     |
| Gradle     | any     |
| JVM        | any     |
| Grails     | any     |
| Scala      | any     |
| Play       | any     |
| PHP        | any     |
| Go         | any     |

You don't find a cool language? [Suggest us to support it][urls.qovery_roadmap]

#### Option 2: Dockerfile

Qovery runs your application within the [Container technology](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container). To build and run your application, you need to provide a valid [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder).

```Dockerfile title="Valid NodeJS Dockerfile"
FROM node:13-alpine
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 3000
CMD node ./bin/www
```

After creating a Dockerfile, specify the location of your Dockerfile in `Dockefile path` field.

Configuration from above will make Qovery look for the Dockerfile in `/timescale/Dockerfile` path of your repository (`Root Application Path` + `Dockerfile Path`).

#### Auto Deploy

See the [Deploying with auto-deploy feature][docs.qovery.deployment.deploying-with-auto-deploy] section.

#### Extra labels/annotations

Add your extra annotation/label groups. See the [Add annotation/label group][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.labels-annotations] section for more information.

### Resources

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/app-13.png" alt="CPU" />
</p>

#### CPU

To configure the number of CPUs that your app needs, adjust the setting in the `Resources` section of the application configuration.

<Alert type="info">

Default is 500m (0.5 vCPU). 

</Alert>

Please note that in this section you configure the CPU allocated by the cluster for your application and that cannot consume more than this value. Even if the application is underused and consumes fewer resources, the cluster will still reserve the selected amount of CPU.

#### RAM

To configure the amount of RAM that your app needs, adjust the setting in `Resources` section of the application configuration.

<Alert type="info">

Default is 512MB.

</Alert>

Please note that in this section you configure the CPU allocated by the cluster for your application and that cannot consume more than this value. Even if the application is underused and consume less resources, the cluster will still reserve the selected amount of CPU. If your application requires more RAM than requested, it will be killed by the kubernetes scheduler.

#### Auto-scaling

Application auto-scaling is based on real-time CPU consumption. When your app goes above 60% of CPU consumption for 15 seconds, your app will be auto-scaled and more instances will be added. It is transparent. The downscale will happen if the CPU consumption is lower than 60% for at least 5 minutes.
You can adjust the minimum and maximum of instances you need in your application settings. Qovery runs your application on Kubernetes and relies on [metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) service to auto-scale your app.

### Storage

#### Block Storage

The default filesystem for applications running on Qovery is ephemeral. Application data isn’t persisted across deploys and restarts, which works just fine for most apps because they use managed databases to persist data.

However, many applications need persistent disk storage that isn’t ephemeral. These include:

* Blogging platforms and CMSs like WordPress, Ghost, and Strapi.
* Collaboration apps like Mattermost, GitLab, and Discourse.

This is where Qovery block Storage comes in. Qovery applications can use storage to store data that persists across deploys and restarts, making it easy to deploy stateful applications.

<Alert type="warning">

For most use cases, it is better to use [Object Storage][docs.using-qovery.configuration.object-storage] instead of Block Storage.

</Alert>

###### Use cases

###### ✅ Good use cases

- For I/O intensive applications (E.g. database)
- To store temporary files

###### ❌ Bad use cases

- To store file > 1 TB
- To expose files from an application (E.g. images)

##### Types of Block Storage

Qovery Storage supports:

| Type     | Max IOPS | Max Throughput | Min Size | Max Size                          | Use cases                                                                 |
|----------|----------|----------------|----------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fast_ssd | 64000    | 1GB/s          | 5GB      | 10GB `Community` / 1TB paid plans | Critical business applications that require sustained IOPS like databases |

##### Configuration

You can set up your Block Storage in `Storage` section of your application configuration.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/app-7.png" alt="Application Storage" />
</p>

<Alert type="info">

Storage can be added only if the application has never been deployed before AND if it runs only with one instance (check the [Resources section][docs.configuration.application#resources])

</Alert>

### Ports

Within this section you can define the port exposed by your application to the other services or even over the internet.
You can edit the existing ports or declare new ones by specifying:
- Application port: this is the port exposed internally by your application for the other services. 
- Protocol: you can select the protocol used by your application : HTTP (for both standard HTTP or websocket communications), gRPC, TCP, UDP.
- Publicly exposed: it allows you to expose over the public network your service. A public domain will be assigned to your application during the deployment (see [Connectin from the internet section](#connecting-from-the-internet))
- If Publicly Exposed is selected:
  - External port: it is the port that can be used to access this service over the internet (when exposed publicly). Note that for HTTP and gRPC the port is set by default to 443.
  - Port Name: it is the name assigned to the port. When multiple ports are exposed publicly, its value is used to route the traffic to the right port based on the called subdomain (which will contain the port name value). Since each port is exposed on the port 443, having a different subdomain is the only way to have multiple ports exposed over the internet. If not set, the default value is `p<portNumber>` (see [Qovery Provided Domain section](#qovery-provided-domains) for more information)

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/app-15.png" alt="Application Ports" />
</p>


#### Important Informations

- Most of the Kubernetes Health Checks][docs.using-qovery.configuration.service-health-checks] are based on the port declared in this section. Make sure you declare the right port and that you configure the health checks properly.
- Connections on public ports are automatically closed after 60 seconds. If you want to implement long living connection (like for websockets) please make sure to use the rigth ingress timeouts in the [advanced settings section][docs.using-qovery.configuration.advanced-settings#network-settings]
- Exposing publicly TCP/UDP ports requires to create a dedicated load balancer and it takes a few minutes before having it ready (~15 minutes). Note also that this has a direct impact on your cloud provider bill.
- You can configure your application to use the **PORT** environment variable by adding the **PORT** on your application env variables page.
- A Note on Listening IPs: It's best for your application to listen on `0.0.0.0:$PORT`. While most things work with `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`, some do not (NodeJS for example)

### Health Checks

To know more about how to configure your Liveness and Readiness probes, have a look at [the health-checks section][docs.using-qovery.configuration.application-health-checks]

### Deployment Restrictions

This section allows to specify which changes on your repository should trigger an auto-deploy (if enabled). To know more about how to configure your Deployment Restrictions, have a look at the [deployment restrictions section][docs.using-qovery.deployment.deploying-with-auto-deploy#filtering-commits-triggering-the-auto-deploy].

### Domains

Within this section you can customize the domain used to reach your application. 

You can customize the domain of your application in different ways, depending on what you want to achieve:
* You want to use your own domain for your application
* You want to modify the subdomain assigned to your application by Qovery (i.e. change `p80-zdf72de72-z709e1a88-gtw.za8ad0657.bool.sh` into `my-app-domain.za8ad0657.bool.sh`).

In both cases, you can assign the new custom domain to your application press the `Add Domain` button. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/app-16.png" alt="Application Domains" />
</p>

<Alert type="info">

This configuration will be **automatically removed** on every cloned environment or preview environment in order to avoid domain collision.

</Alert>

#### Configuring your own domain

Once the domain is added within the Qovery console (Example: mydomain.com), you need to configure within your DNS two `CNAME` records pointing to the domain provided by Qovery, as shown in the UI (example: mydomain.com CNAME za7cc1b71-z4b8474b3-gtw.zc531a994.rustrocks.cloud and *.mydomain.com CNAME za7cc1b71-z4b8474b3-gtw.zc531a994.rustrocks.cloud). 

Having a wildcard domain (example: *.mydomain.com) configured on your DNS will avoid you to modify the Qovery setup every time you want to add a new subdomain. If `wildcard` is not supported by your DNS provider, you will have to configure each subdomain manually.

If the service needs to expose more than one port publicly, you can define a dedicated subdomain to redirect the traffic on the right port by setting the “Port Name” value within the [port settings](#ports).

From this point, Qovery will automatically handle the TLS/SSL certificate creation and renewal for the configured domain.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/custom-domain.png" alt="Custom Domain" />
</p>

** Special case - CDN in proxy mode **

If your service is behind a CDN using a `proxy mode` (i.e. the traffic is routed through the CDN to Qovery), make sure to disable the option "Generate certificate" on the domain setup. Since the certificate of your domain is directly managed by the CDN, Qovery won't be able to do that for you and it will raise warnings on your application status.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/configuration/application/cdn-proxy.png" alt="CDN Proxy" />
</p>

<Alert type="info">

[We prepared a guide and video tutorial that explains how to set up your custom domain.][guides.getting-started.setting-custom-domain]

</Alert>

#### Change the auto assigned sub-domain

You can specify a different sub-domain for your application as long as it belongs to the assigned cluster domain (see [Qovery provided domains](#qovery-provided-domains)). 
Example: 
- your current domain is zdf72de71-z709e1a85-gtw.za8ad0659.bool.sh (so your assigned cluster domain is `za8ad0659.bool.sh`)
- you can enter a new custom domain `myfrontend.za8ad0659.bool.sh` (since it is a subdomain of the cluster domain)

The application will now be accessible from both the default and the new custom domain.

<Alert type="info">

Qovery does not check collision in the domain declaration. Make sure you assign a unique subdomain within your cluster.

</Alert>

## Connecting from the internet

Your application can be reached from the internet by publicly exposing at least one of its ports (See the [Ports](#ports) section to know more). Once this is done, Qovery will generate for you a domain to reach your application from the internet. You can also customize the domain assigned to your application and manage by yourself this assignment via the `Domain` section.

### Qovery provided domains

For each port publicly exposed, a domain is automatically assigned by Qovery to your application. Qovery will manage for you the networking and the TLS configuration for these domains. 

Example: `p80-zdf72de72-z709e1a88-gtw.za8ad0657.bool.sh` or `<service_name>-p80-zdf72de72-z709e1a88-gtw.za8ad0657.bool.sh` for helm services.

Note:
- each service deployed on the same cluster will have the same root domain assigned (example: `za8ad0657.bool.sh`)
- the first characters of the domain (before the `-`) is based on the portName given to the port associated with this domain (See the [port section](#ports))
- a default domain (without the portName) is assigned to the `default port`(See the [port section](#ports)). Example `zdf72de72-z709e1a88-gtw.za8ad0657.bool.sh`

**Special Case - Preview Environment** 
For each port exposed publicly, an additional domain will be created with the following pattern `portName-prId-srvName-envSourceName.cluster_domain`:
- portName: is the port name, as explained above
- prID: is the id of the PR that has generated the preview environment
- srvName: is the name of the service
- envSourceName: is the name of the blueprint environment that has created the current preview environment

domain example: `p80-123-frontend-blueprint.za8ad0657.bool.sh`

### Custom domains

If you prefer to assign your own domain to the application, have a look at the [Domain section](#domains) to know more.

### Advanced Settings

You can further customize the service behaviour via the service advanced settings. Check [this documentation][docs.using-qovery.configuration.advanced-settings] to know more.

## Logs

To learn how to display your application logs, navigate to [logs section][docs.using-qovery.deployment.logs#live-logs]

## SSH

To connect to your application via SSH, please use the via the [Qovery SSH command][docs.using-qovery.interface.cli] available on our CLI.

## Clone

You can create a clone of the service via the clone feature. A new service with the same configuration (see below for exceptions) will be created into the target environment.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/clone_service.png" alt="Clone Service" />
</p>

The target environment can be the same as the current environment or even another one in a completely different project.

** Important information **

Not every configuration parameter will be copied within the new service for consistency reasons. The configuration is fully or partially copied depending on the target environment:
- same environment:
    - custom domain: this setup is not copied into the new service (to avoid collision)
- another environment:
    - custom domain: this setup is not copied into the new service (to avoid collision)
    - environment variable: aliases defined on environment variables are not copied (since the aliased env var might not exist)
    - deployment pipeline: stage setup is not copied (since the target stage might not exist)
    - number of instances: if the target environment runs on a Qovery EC2 cluster, the max number of instances is set to 1 (Qovery EC2 constraint)

Please check the configuration of the new service before deploying it.
