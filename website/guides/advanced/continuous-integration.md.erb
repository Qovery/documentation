Qovery integrates with all existing Continuous Integration platforms. We have a [guide for the most popular CI platforms][docs.using-qovery.integration.continuous-integration]. However, even if you don't find your CI platform, [you can see here][docs.using-qovery.integration.continuous-integration.github-actions] that integrating Qovery into a CI is just a matter of:

1. Adding a new step into your CI pipeline
2. Installing the Qovery CLI
3. Running the `qovery <application|container|lifecycle|cronjob> deploy ...` commands

## Resources

Here are some resources you can use to integrate Qovery into your CI platform:
