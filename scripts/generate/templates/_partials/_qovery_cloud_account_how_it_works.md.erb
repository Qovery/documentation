## How Qovery works on <%= cloud_provider %>

Qovery is an abstraction layer on top of <%= cloud_provider %> and Kubernetes. Qovery manages the configuration of <%= cloud_provider %> account, and helps your to deploy production ready apps in seconds.
To make it works, Qovery rely on Kubernetes for stateless apps (containers), and  <%= cloud_provider %> for stateful apps (databases, storage...).

### Kubernetes

The first time you set up your <%= cloud_provider %> account, Qovery creates a Kubernetes cluster in your chosen region. Qovery managed it for you - no action required. It takes ~15 minutes to configure and bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. Once bootstrapped, your Kubernetes cluster runs the Qovery app and is ready to deploy your applications.

### Managed services

<%= cloud_provider %> provides managed services for PostgreSQL and MySQL. Qovery gives you access to those services when you set the [environment mode][docs.using-qovery.configuration.business.policy#environment-mode] to `Production`. In `Development` mode, Qovery provides containers equivalent, which is cheaper and faster to start.

### Security and compliance

Qovery runs your Kubernetes cluster and is autonomous to manage your applications, which means:
- Your configuration are stored on your <%= cloud_provider %> account.
- Your configuration is encrypted on your <%= cloud_provider %> account.
- Qovery can't access to your data.
