**Preview environment** is a feature that will allow the rest of your team to view the branch you are working on when it's ready to be merged.
When you create a pull request, you can have access to a fully dynamic environment. 

<!--
     THIS FILE IS AUTOGENERATED!

     To make changes please edit the template located at:

     website/docs/using-qovery/configuration/preview-env.md.erb
-->

## How does it works?

First, you will need to select the environment needed from the environment setting panel, you can either choose to use it for all of your environments or just select the one you want thanks to a toggle.

After creating a new branch, add the changes that you want and create a pull request then just go back to your Qovery console and you will have your new pull request directly in your new environment so you and your team can test it.

### Preview environment when "auto-remove" is activated

If the "auto-remove" mode is activated in the deployment rules, 
the clone environment will be deleted as soon as your pull request has been approved and merge to your main branch.
