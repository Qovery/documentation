### Why don't you allow users to pay their credits?

**Qovery IS NOT a hosting platform and will never be**. We offer free hosting because it is our way to give back to the our developers community.

1. 48 hours, Qovery will shut down your applications.
2. 30 days, Qovery will permanently delete your applications
