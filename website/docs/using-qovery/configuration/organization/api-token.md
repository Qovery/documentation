API token allows third-party applications or script to access your organization via the Qovery API (CI/CD, Terraform script, Pulumi etc..).

You can manage the API tokens attached to your organization directly from the Qovery console.

<Alert type="info">

You can manage the API tokens of your organization with the [Qovery CLI][docs.using-qovery.interface.cli#generate-api-token] as well

</Alert>

You can access the token API configuration by opening the `Token API` section within the organization settings.

## Create a new token

You can create a new token API by pressing the `Add` button. You need to provide:
- A name
- A description
- A role: this allows to manage the permission assigned to the new API Token. The permission is managed via the [Qovery RBAC system][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization.members-rbac#roles-based-access-control-rbac]

Once validated the token value will be displayed on the interface.

<Alert type="info">

Make sure you safely store the token returned by the UI. You won't be able to retrieve it again (you will have to create a new one)

</Alert>

## Delete a token

You can create a new token API by pressing the `Bin` button next to the Token you want to delete.

## Edit a token

This functionality is not yet available
