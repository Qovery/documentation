[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) is an open-source infrastructure as code software (IaC) tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. Terraform codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files.

Terraform can be used in 2 context:

1. [Qovery can be controlled via Terraform](#deploy-qovery-with-terraform). This allows you to automate the creation of your organization, project, clusters, applications and environments (and more).
2. [Qovery can be used to deploy your Terraform code](#deploy-your-terraform-code-with-qovery). This allows you to automate the deployment of your infrastructure.

## Deploy Qovery with Terraform

Qovery integrates with Terraform to create a complete workflow with a strong developer and operations experience for the different teams from development to critical production applications. By integrating Terraform with Qovery, your team can quickly implement governance at scale while drastically improving the developer experience when deploying and managing applications.

## Deploy your Terraform code with Qovery

Qovery can deploy your Terraform code. It's very useful when you want to deploy your own cloud resources. For example, you can deploy your own databases, lambdas, brokers etc...
To do so, you need to use the [Lifecycle Jobs][docs.using-qovery.configuration.lifecycle-job] feature.

<Alert type="info">

Lifecycle Jobs can be used to deploy any kind of code. It's not limited to Terraform. It works with Serverless, Pulumi, Helm etc...
