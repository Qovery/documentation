## How do I delete a cluster with dependency violation errors?

When attempting to delete a Qovery cluster, you may encounter dependency violation errors (`DependencyViolation`) indicating that certain items cannot be deleted due to existing dependencies.
This typically happens when there are resources using the items (here: subnets) that were not deployed or managed by Qovery. Example:

```
DeleteError - Unknown error while performing Terraform command (`terraform destroy -lock=false -no-color -auto-approve`), here is the error:

Error: deleting EC2 Subnet (subnet-xxx): operation error EC2: DeleteSubnet, https response error StatusCode: 400, RequestID: xxx, api error DependencyViolation: The subnet 'subnet-xxx' has dependencies and cannot be deleted.
```

To resolve subnet deletion errors and successfully delete your cluster, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your cloud provider console
2. Navigate to the VPC section (or the section where deletion items are in failure)
3. Attempt to delete the items (here: subnet) that is failing. This will trigger a notification showing the blocking elements

</p>

4. Review the items (here: Network interfaces) that are blocking the deletion:

* Check the Interface Type and Description for each blocking resource
* Verify that these resources are safe to delete and not being used by any critical services.

</p>

5. Delete the identified blocking network interfaces if they are no longer needed
6. Return to Qovery and retry the cluster deletion process

## I don't have Qovery access anymore, how could I delete Qovery deployed resources on my AWS account?

### From the AWS console

Unfortunately, there is no automatic way to do it with Qovery once we don't have access. However, AWS provides an easy way to retrieve those resources, so you can manually perform the delete. To do so, go on the AWS web console, and search for "Resource Groups & Tag Editor" service, then:

<p Valign="center">
  <img src="/img/aws_resource_groups.png" alt="Resource groups search by tag" />
</p>

1. Click on "Create Resource Group".
2. In Tags, enter: "ClusterLongId".
3. In the "Optional Tag value", enter the Qovery cluster ID. If you don't have it, let AWS suggest it for you. If you have Qovery deployed elements remainings, it will propose the Cluster long ID automatically.
4. Click on "Add".
5. You should see the filter with the information you just entered.
6. Click on "Preview groups resources".
7. You'll have all elements deployed by Qovery and you can delete what you want.

### From the CLI

If you want to be able to delete the resources deployed by Qovery, you can use the AWS CLI to list and delete the resources. Here is an example of how to list all the resources deployed by Qovery:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
VPC_ID=$1
echo "Resources in VPC: $VPC_ID"

echo "Subnets:"
aws ec2 describe-subnets --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC_ID"

echo "Route Tables:"
aws ec2 describe-route-tables --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC_ID"

echo "Security Groups:"
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC_ID"

echo "NATs Gateway:"
aws ec2 describe-nat-gateways --filter "Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC_ID"

echo "Internet Gateway:"
aws ec2 describe-internet-gateways --filters "Name=attachment.vpc-id,Values=$VPC_ID"

echo "Instances:"
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC_ID"

echo "Network Interfaces:"
aws ec2 describe-network-interfaces --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC_ID"

echo "EC2 Instances:"
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC_ID"

echo "S3 VPC Endpoints:"
aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoints --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC_ID"

echo "Load Balancers:"
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --query "LoadBalancers[?VpcId=='$VPC_ID']"
echo "Load Balancers:"
aws elb describe-load-balancers --query "LoadBalancers[?VpcId=='$VPC_ID']" 
```

## My cloud account has been blockVed, what should I do?

If you encounter this kind of error during an infrastructure deployment (including managed DBs):

```bash
This account is currently blocked by your cloud provider, please contact them directly.
```

Or

```bash
This AWS account is currently blocked and not recognized as a valid account.
Please contact aws-verification@amazon.com directly to get more details.
Maybe you are not allowed to use your free tier in this region?
Maybe you need to provide billing info?
```

This error is likely due to a billing issue or blocked free-tier usage in the given region.

Unfortunately, there is nothing Qovery can do. You need to reach out directly to your cloud provider to get more details and get your account unblocked.

<Alert type="info">
If you are using AWS, you can contact them directly via dedicated email: aws-verification@amazon.com.
