## Managed Cluster by Qovery vs. Self-Managed - What to choose?

Qovery offers two distinct approaches to cluster management: `Cluster Managed by Qovery` and `Self-managed Cluster`.
Choose `Cluster Managed by Qovery` if you are not familiar with Kubernetes or you don't want to bother with it and delegate infrastructure management to Qovery. Choose `Self-Managed` otherwise.

Here is a table to help you to choose between both:

| Feature/Aspect                        | Cluster Managed by Qovery (recommended)        | Self-Managed Cluster (advanced)                  |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Management**                        | Fully managed by Qovery                        | Self-managed by the organization                 |
| **Control**                           | Limited control over Kubernetes infrastructure | Full control over Kubernetes setup               |
| **Supported Cloud Service Providers** | AWS, GCP, Scaleway                             | All                                              |
| **Customization**                     | Standard Qovery configuration                  | High customization and configuration freedom     |
| **Expertise Required**                | None                                           | Requires Kubernetes expertise                    |
| **Responsibility**                    | Qovery is responsible for maintenance          | Organization is responsible for maintenance      |
| **Developer Experience**              | Streamlined and simplified                     | Streamlined and simplified (no difference)       |
| **Setup Complexity**                  | Just a AWS, GCP or Scaleway account            | Requires infrastructure and Kubernetes knowledge |
| **Flexibility in Usage**              | Standardized to Qovery's environment           | Flexible to meet specific organizational needs   |
| **Ideal Use Case**                    | Organizations preferring a hands-off approach  | Organizations with specific Kubernetes needs     |
| **Managed Services**                  | Cf. list below                                 | N/A                                              |
