On Qovery, every application exposed publicly automatically gets a temporary `qovery.io` domain. You can also bring your domains to Qovery
quickly. We handle TLS/SSL certificate creation and renewal, as well as automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirects for all your custom domains. Letâ€™s
learn how to set up your domains on Qovery!

<Assumptions>

* You have a domain
* You have the permission to add a [CNAME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record) record to your domain

</Assumptions>

## Tutorial

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

<li>

### Add the domain to your app

<div class="video-container">
  <p align="center">
    <iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/cd9c56a133164005bfeb7db23d2b6ed1" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
  </p>
</div>

</li>
<li>

### Configure your DNS

Configure your DNS by adding a CNAME record pointing to the domain provided by Qovery in the previous step

If you have multiple public ports (or you want to have them in the future), make sure you add a CNAME for both yourdomain.com and *.yourdomain.com. 

In this way:
- your application default port will be accessible via the domain `yourdomain.com` or by a subdomain equal to the port name (portNameA.yourdomain.com). 
- the other application public port will be accessible via a subdomain equal to the portName (portNameB.yourdomain.com). 

See the [port setup of your application][docs.using-qovery.configuration.application#ports] for more information on the port name setup.

</li>

<li>

### Your domain is ready

You need to **restart** your app to use your custom domain on your application.
