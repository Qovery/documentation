Thank you for your interest! You are more and more to request the support of Qovery for [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) (Microsoft Azure). However, we do not support it yet. You have 2 ways of speed up the support:

1. Upvote the support of Microsoft Azure [here](https://roadmap.qovery.com/roadmap/support-azure).
2. We are hiring backend and frontend engineers to build the future of the Cloud. It could be you? ðŸ˜„ [Apply here][urls.qovery_jobs]

Today, Qovery supports the following Cloud providers:
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)][guides.cloud-provider.guide-amazon-web-services]
