### Cloud cost optimization
Where Heroku makes you consume more and more resources to spend more, Qovery does the opposite. We earn money because you use and love Qovery. And to fulfill our mission, we help you to reduce your Cloud cost by doing simple operations like:

* Automatically turning off unused resources.
* Autoscale up and down your apps according to real usage.
* Reduce the number of dependencies - which leads to lower costs and problems.

### Qovery lets you use your AWS credits
As Qovery runs on your AWS account, you are free to use your credits. We also want to support you and give you free access to Qovery ([contact us][urls.qovery_contact_us]), then you can start as soon as possible to focus on your business.

### Better performance and reliability
As Qovery runs on your AWS account, You have to compare AWS to Heroku. Googling `Heroku vs. AWS performance and reliability` will find that benchmarks show that AWS provides better performance and reliability than Heroku at a lower cost.

### Infrastructure and DevOps control

* Heroku's infrastructure is hidden for good and bad reasons. The problem is that you have no control over it. Qovery relies on the managed services provided by the Cloud provider. You have full control of the type of resources you want to allocate and put your hands on if required. Qovery is transparent, where Heroku is a black box.

* Heroku focuses on the developer needs only, Qovery focuses on the developer needs and provides full control to a DevOps team via a [plugin system][docs.main-concepts.business]. To go further than that, Qovery generates Terraform and Helm files (familiar to DevOps) to deploy the infrastructure and the developers' apps. If the DevOps is not satisfied by the default configuration of Qovery, they can change it.

### Qovery is built for privacy
Qovery does not host your apps and your data. Your data are stored on your AWS account. Even your app logs are stored on your AWS account and encrypted. Privacy is the present and the future; that's why Qovery is privacy proof by design.

### Qovery covers all regions
Low latency on your app means a better experience for your users. Being physically close to them is critical. That's why Qovery is available all around the world. Thanks to AWS and its global coverage.

| Region              | Qovery                       | Heroku                           |

### Customer focus
Qovery offers all its customers community and email support staffed by the same world-class engineers who build the platform. Qovery’s product roadmap is public. You can submit feature requests and get notified as soon as we start working on them. This keeps us accountable and helps us understand your needs better. Heroku does the opposite. They don't involve their users and take actions for their own purpose.

### No vendor lock-in
1. Our [deployment engine][urls.qovery_engine] is open-source.
2. Reversibility: Your apps run on your AWS account. If you are not satisfied with our product, we give you access to all generated configuration files (Terraform, Helm, and others) and keep running your infrastructure.

Where Heroku is a black box. They do everything they can to lock you and keep you forever.
