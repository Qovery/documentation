Building multi-tenant applications where each customer has their own dedicated URL is a common pattern in SaaS platforms. While Qovery automatically handles TLS/SSL certificate creation and renewal for your custom domains, managing certificates at scale for multi-tenant architectures presents unique challenges. This guide will show you how to implement a robust certificate management strategy using dedicated ingresses for each tenant.

## **The Challenge**

When building multi-tenant applications on Qovery, the default approach uses a single ingress controller to manage all custom domains for the service. This creates several issues:

* **Certificate generation failures**: If validation fails for one domain, it can prevent certificate generation for all domains
* **Deployment risks**: A single misconfigured domain can cause the entire deployment to fail
* **Privacy concerns**: Customers can see other tenants' domains when inspecting the SSL certificate
* **Certificate limits**: Let's Encrypt has rate limits that can be reached when managing many domains on a single certificate

## **The Solution: Dedicated Ingresses Per Tenant**

</p>

Instead of managing all domains through a single ingress, we'll create a dedicated ingress for each customer. This approach provides:

* **Isolation**: Each tenant gets their own certificate and ingress configuration
* **Reliability**: Issues with one tenant's domain won't affect others
* **Privacy**: Certificates only contain the specific tenant's domain
* **Scalability**: Easier to manage rate limits and certificate renewals

## **Implementation Guide**

### **Prerequisites**

* A Qovery account with a configured cluster
* DNS management access for your domains

### **Step 1: Organize Your Infrastructure (Optional but Recommended)**

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/certificate_management_for_multi_tenant_infrastructure/environment_structure.png" alt="Qovery Platform" />
</p>

While not mandatory, creating separate environments helps maintain a clean separation between your core infrastructure and tenant-specific configurations.

1. **Create an Infrastructure Environment**

    This environment will host your main application components (frontend, API, database, etc.).

   * Navigate to your project dashboard
   * Click "Create new environment"
   * Name it "Infrastructure" or similar
   * Configure your environment settings

2. **Create a Tenants Environment**

    This dedicated environment will contain all tenant-specific ingress configurations.

   * Create another environment
   * Name it "Tenants" or "Customers"
   * This provides logical separation and easier management

### **Step 2: Deploy Your Main Application**

If you haven't already deployed your application, follow the [Qovery deployment guide](https://hub.qovery.com/guides/getting-started/deploy-your-first-application/).

For this example, we'll use a simple web application:

1. **Deploy your container**

   * Use the Qovery UI, our [CLI](https://hub.qovery.com/docs/using-qovery/interface/cli/),  our [Terraform Provider](https://hub.qovery.com/docs/using-qovery/integration/terraform-provider/) or our [REST API](https://hub.qovery.com/docs/using-qovery/interface/rest-api/) to deploy your application
   * For testing, you can use a simple nginx container

2. **Configure the application port**

   * Navigate to Settings → Ports
   * Click "Add port"
   * Configure:
     * Port: 80 (or your application's port exposed by your container)
     * Protocol: HTTP
     * Exposure: Publicly exposed

3. **Add your main domain** (optional)

   * Go to Settings → Domains
   * Click "Add domain"
   * Enter your primary domain
   * Configure the required CNAME records in your DNS provider

4. **Note important values**

    Before proceeding, save these values from your application's built-in environment variables:

   * `QOVERY_CONTAINER_XXXXXXX_HOST_INTERNAL`: The internal hostname of your application
   * `QOVERY_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME`: Your environment's namespace

5. You can find these in the Variables section of your application.

### **Step 3: Create Tenant-Specific Ingresses**

Now we'll create dedicated ingresses for each tenant using Helm charts.

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/certificate_management_for_multi_tenant_infrastructure/implementation_flow.png" alt="Implementation Steps Flow" />
</p>

1. **Switch to your Tenants environment** (if you created one)

2. **Create a new Helm service**

    We'll use an empty Helm chart, Qovery will create an ingress resource. You can use this [empty chart template](https://github.com/Guimove/empty-chart) or create your own.

   * Click "Create new service"
   * Select "Helm"
   * Name it after your tenant (e.g., "tenant-acme-corp")
   * Use the empty chart repository
   * Keep default values (no overrides needed)
   * Select only “Create” at the end of the create wizard

3. **Configure the ingress**

    Navigate to Settings → Ports and add a port:

   * Service name: Use the `QOVERY_CONTAINER_XXXXXXX_HOST_INTERNAL` value
   * Namespace: Use `QOVERY_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME` (if using separate environments)


4. **Add the tenant's custom domain**

   * Go to Settings → Domains
   * Add the tenant's specific domain
   * Ensure the tenant configures their DNS records

5. **Deploy the service**

    Deploy the Helm chart. Qovery will:

   * Create a dedicated ingress for this tenant
   * Generate a separate SSL certificate
   * Route traffic to your main application

### **Step 4: Scale to Multiple Tenants**

For additional tenants, you have two options:

1. **Clone existing tenant configuration**

   * Clone an existing tenant service
   * Update the name and domain
   * Deploy

2. **Create from scratch**

   * Repeat Step 3 for each new tenant

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Certificate Generation Issues**

1. **Check DNS propagation**

```shell
dig _acme-challenge.tenant-domain.com CNAME
```

2. **Verify ingress configuration**

   * Check the Qovery deployment logs
   * Ensure the domain is correctly configured

3. **Monitor cert-manager logs**
   * Access your cluster logs to see certificate generation details

### **Routing Issues**

1. **Verify internal service name on the tenant port configuration**
   * Ensure the service name matches your application's internal hostname
2. **Check namespace configuration**
   * Confirm the namespace is correct if using separate environments

## **Conclusion**

By implementing dedicated ingresses for each tenant, you create a more robust, scalable, and secure multi-tenant architecture on Qovery. This approach provides better isolation, easier troubleshooting, and improved privacy for your customers.
