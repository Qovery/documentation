An organization is a shared account where developers can collaborate across many projects at once. Owners and organization administrators
can manage every aspect of the organization, from the clusters up to the member access.

## Creating an Organization

### When Signing Up

When signing up for Qovery, you need to create an organization. You can choose between 4 plans:

- Free
- Team
- Business
- Enterprise

For more information, see [our pricing page][urls.qovery_pricing].

Once you have chosen a plan, you need to sign in through your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket). Your organization is then created.

### After Signing Up

Qovery lets you create as many as you want organizations. Each organization is independent of the others.
To create a new organization:

1. Click on your profile icon button on the left navbar.
2. Click on the `+` button in the top right corner of the dropdown.
