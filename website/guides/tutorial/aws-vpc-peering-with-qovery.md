While Qovery is all you need to deploy and run your applications in AWS, you might have existing resources in another VPC that you want to access from your Qovery applications.
This tutorial will show you how to set up VPC peering between the Qovery VPC and an existing one in your account.

<Assumptions name="guide">

* You have an existing AWS VPC with a resource you need to access, like an RDS database
* You have a [Qovery cluster ready on your AWS account](https://hub.qovery.com/guides/tutorial/how-to-deploy-your-application-on-aws-in-30-minutes)

</Assumptions>

<Alert type="warning">
    Make sure the CIDR blocks of your two VPCs don't overlap. AWS won't allow the peering connection otherwise.
    <br /><br />
    To match this requirement, you can customize the Qovery VPC CIDR at cluster creation:

## Goal 

In this tutorial, we will connect an existing VPC on our AWS account with the VPC of a Qovery managed cluster. 
We should then be able to deploy an application using a PostgreSQL RDS instance in our existing VPC.

<Steps headingDepth={3}>

<ol>

<li>

#### Gather the necessary information

Before we begin, you will need to gather some information. It is recommended that you keep this information at hand in a file for convenience.

At the end of this step 1, you should have those elements:

| Name | Content |
|------|---------|
| **VPC source CIDR** | x.x.x.x/x |
| **VPC source name** | vpc-xxx |
| **VPC destination CIDR** | y.y.y.y/y |
| **VPC destination name** | vpc-yyy |

Keep in mind the following convention:
* Existing VPC: your current VPC infrastructure (not managed by Qovery)
* Qovery VPC: the VPC deployed and managed by Qovery

<p></p>

##### Your existing VPC ID

To get your existing VPC ID in your AWS console, go to: `VPC > Your VPCs`, find the VPC you would like to use as a peering target, and copy its ID

You will be able to have those information:

| Name | Content |
|------|---------|
| **VPC destination CIDR** | x.x.x.x/x |
| **VPC destination name** | vpc-xxx |

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/aws-vpc-peering-with-qovery/vpc-console-1.png" alt="AWS console VPC list" />
</p>


##### The Qovery VPC ID

You can use the same method to get the Qovery VPC ID. It should be named `qovery-eks-workers`.

You will be able to have those information:

| Name | Content |
|------|---------|
| **VPC source CIDR** | x.x.x.x/x |
| **VPC source name** | vpc-xxx |
<p></p>

</li>

##### The CIDR ranges of both VPCs


<Alert type="warning">
    Make sure the CIDR blocks of your two VPCs don't overlap or you won't be able to create the peering connection.
</Alert>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/aws-vpc-peering-with-qovery/find-cidr.png" alt="AWS console VPC CIDR ranges" />
</p>

</li>

<li>

#### Create a peering connection

> A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them privately.

In the AWS console, go to `VPC > Peering connections` and click on `Create peering connection`

- Give it a name
- As a requester, select your Qovery VPC
- As an accepter, select your existing VPC
- Click on `Create peering connection`

<br/>

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/aws-vpc-peering-with-qovery/peering-form.png" alt="AWS create VPC peering form" />
</p>    

</li>

<li>

#### Accept the peering request

Once created, the peering connection needs to be accepted. 
On the peering connection view, click on `Actions` then `Accept request`

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/aws-vpc-peering-with-qovery/accept-peering-request.png" alt="AWS accept VPC peering request" />
</p>    

You should see your peering connection marked as `Active`

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/aws-vpc-peering-with-qovery/peering-active.png" alt="AWS VPC peering active" />
</p>    

<Alert type="info">
<b>Take note of the peering connection ID. You will need it later.</b>
</Alert>

</li>

<li>

#### Update existing VPC route table

In the AWS console of your existing VPC, go to `VPC > Route Tables`.
You can filter the list using the IDs you noted at step 1 to find the routes table for each VPC.

For your Qovery VPC edit the `qovery-eks-workers` route table:

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/aws-vpc-peering-with-qovery/qovery-rt.png" alt="AWS VPC Qovery Route Table" />
</p>    

Click on the `Edit routes` button then `Add route`. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/aws-vpc-peering-with-qovery/qovery-rt-add.png" alt="AWS VPC Qovery Route Table add route" />
</p> 

- As a destination, enter the CIDR of your Qovery VPC
- As a target, select the `Peering connection` you created earlier

Click `Save changes`.

<Alert type="warning">
    Do not alter existing routes. Make sure you are adding a new one.
</Alert>

</li>

<li>

#### Update Qovery VPC route table

This part needs to be done through the Qovery console. 

<Alert type="warning">
    Make sure you are adding a new route. Do not edit or remove existing routes to avoid service interruption.
</Alert>

In the cluster settings, under the `Network` tab, click `ADD ROUTE`

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/aws-vpc-peering-with-qovery/qovery-rt.png" alt="AWS VPC Qovery Route Table add route" />
</p> 

- As a destination, enter the CIDR of your existing VPC
- As a target, enter the ID of the peering connection you created earlier
- You can put anything you want as a description.

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/aws-vpc-peering-with-qovery/qovery-rt-added.png" alt="AWS VPC Qovery Route Table add route" />
</p> 

</li>

<li>

#### Update the security groups

Our two VPCs are now connected, but we still need to update the security groups to allow communication between the Qovery applications and your existing resources.

What rules to put on your security groups depends on what you are trying to achieve. 
In our case, we would like to access an RDS instance from our Qovery applications.

We will edit the RDS security group in our existing VPC to add an inbound rule allowing PostgreSQL traffic from our Qovery instances: 


<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/aws-vpc-peering-with-qovery/pg-inbound-rule.png" alt="AWS Security Group inbound rules" />
</p> 

</li>

<li>

#### Deploy an application

You should now be able to deploy an application using the RDS PostgreSQL database on your Qovery cluster.
Refer to [this guide][guides.getting-started.deploy-your-first-application] if you need help deploying an application on Qovery.
