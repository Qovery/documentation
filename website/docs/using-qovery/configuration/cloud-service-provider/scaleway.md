Qovery lets you quickly deploy applications to your [Scaleway (Scaleway)][urls.scaleway] account. No knowledge needed, and it takes less than 10 minutes to install Qovery on your Scaleway account.

<Alert type="info">

Do you want to know more about how Qovery works on your Scaleway account? [Here][docs.useful-resources.faq#how-qovery-works-under-the-hood] is explained how Qovery works under the hood.

## Getting started

<Assumptions>

* You have a [Qovery][docs.using-qovery.interface] account
* You have created an [Organization][docs.using-qovery.configuration.organization]
* You have a Scaleway account

</Assumptions>

### Connect your Scaleway account

To link your Scaleway account to Qovery you need to provide a Scaleway `access key id`, `secret access key` and a `project id`.

<Alert type="warning">

If your Scaleway account is new, you need to open a ticket to Scaleway support to unlock your quota. You can post the following message:
"Hello, I am going to deploy my applications on Scaleway with Qovery. Can you increase my quota for current Kubernetes nodes type, to 10 please? Thanks

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

You can link more than one Scaleway account. Qovery also support multiple Cloud providers within the same Organization. Meaning, you can balance your workload on different Cloud providers. [Read more][guides.advanced].

</Alert>

#### Create your Scaleway credentials - `access key id`, `secret access key` and `project id`.

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>

<li>

[Connect to your Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)

</li>

<li>

Go to `Credentials`
<img src="/img/scw-create-credentials-1.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

Copy your `project ID` and generate new API key
<img src="/img/scw-create-credentials-2.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

Generate your new API key
<img src="/img/scw-create-credentials-3.jpg" />

</li>

<li>

Copy the generated `access key id` and `secret access key`.

<img src="/img/scw-create-credentials-4.jpg" />

</li>

</ol>

</Steps>

Well done!! You now have your Scaleway `access key id`, `secret access key` and `project id`; It's time to connect Qovery to your Scaleway account.

#### Use Scaleway credentials with Qovery

*this section is under development - [join us][urls.qovery_chat] and be part of the first to try it*

### Remove your Scaleway account

*this section is under development - [join us][urls.qovery_chat] and be part of the first to try it*

### Delete Qovery from your Scaleway account

<Alert type="warning">

Your applications and your data will be deleted.

</Alert>

To delete Qovery from your Scaleway account you must be the owner of the Organization.
Once your Scaleway account removed from Qovery, everything configured (VPC, Kubernetes, databases, ...) by Qovery will be deleted forever.

## Regions

Qovery supports the following AWS regions:

| | name        | description
|-|-------------|--------------------------
|🇫🇷| fr-par-1   | Paris DC1 (France)
|🇫🇷| fr-par-2   | Paris DC2 (France)
|🇳🇱| nl-ams-1   | Amsterdam DC1 (Netherlands)
|🇵🇱| pl-waw-1   | Warsaw DC1 (Poland)

Qovery supports regions where [Scaleway Kubernetes (Kapsule)](https://www.scaleway.com/en/kubernetes-kapsule/) is supported.

## How Qovery works on Scaleway

Qovery is an abstraction layer on top of Scaleway and Kubernetes. Qovery manages the configuration of Scaleway account, and helps your to deploy production ready apps in seconds.
To make it works, Qovery rely on Kubernetes for stateless apps (containers), and  Scaleway for stateful apps (databases, storage...).

### Kubernetes

The first time you set up your Scaleway account, Qovery creates a Kubernetes cluster in your chosen region. Qovery managed it for you - no action required. It takes ~15 minutes to configure and bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster. Once bootstrapped, your Kubernetes cluster runs the Qovery app and is ready to deploy your applications.

### Managed services

Scaleway provides managed services for [PostgreSQL][docs.using-qovery.configuration.database.postgresql], [MySQL][docs.using-qovery.configuration.database.mysql], [Redis][docs.using-qovery.configuration.database.redis], [MongoDB][docs.using-qovery.configuration.database.mongodb]. Qovery gives you access to those services when you set the [environment mode][docs.using-qovery.configuration.deployment-rule#environment-deployment-rules] to `Production`. In `Development` mode, Qovery provides containers equivalent, which is cheaper and faster to start.

### Security and compliance

Qovery runs your Kubernetes cluster and is autonomous to manage your applications, which means:
- Your configuration are stored on your Scaleway account.
- Your configuration is encrypted on your Scaleway account.
- Qovery can't access to your data.

## FAQ

### How to choose a region?

Different datacenters are located in different geographic areas, and you may want to keep your site physically close to the bulk of your user base for reduced latency.

### I don't find a region that is provided by Scaleway

We are probably testing the support of this region, please [contact us][urls.qovery_contact_us] to know what's the status

### Migrate between Cloud providers and regions

Today, you can't migrate an environment from one region to another after it has been created. Vote [here][urls.qovery_roadmap] if you need this feature.
